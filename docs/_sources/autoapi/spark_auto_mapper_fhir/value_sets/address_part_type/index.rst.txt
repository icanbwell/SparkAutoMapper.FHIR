   This can be a unit designator, such as apartment number, suite number, or
   floor. There may be several unit designators in an address (e.g., "3rd floor,
   Appt. 342"). This can also be a designator pointing away from the location,
   rather than specifying a smaller location within some larger one (e.g., Dutch
   "t.o." means "opposite to" for house boats located across the street facing
   houses).
