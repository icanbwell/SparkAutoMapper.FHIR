   v3.ObservationInterpretation
   From: http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ObservationInterpretation in v3-codesystems.xml
       One or more codes providing a rough qualitative interpretation of the
   observation, such as "normal" / "abnormal", "low" / "high", "better" /
   "worse", "resistant" /  "susceptible", "expected" / "not expected". The value
   set is intended to be for ANY use where coded representation of an
   interpretation is needed.

.. class:: ObservationInterpretationValues

   Codes that specify interpretation of genetic analysis, such as "positive",
   "negative", "carrier", "responsive", etc.
   From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationInterpretation in v3-codesystems.xml

   .. attribute:: GeneticObservationInterpretation
      

      Interpretations of change of quantity and/or severity. At most one of B or W
      and one of U or D allowed.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationInterpretation in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: ObservationInterpretationChange
      

      Technical exceptions resulting in the inability to provide an interpretation.
      At most one allowed. Does not imply normality or severity.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationInterpretation in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: ObservationInterpretationExceptions
      

      Interpretation of normality or degree of abnormality (including critical or
      "alert" level). Concepts in this category are mutually exclusive, i.e., at
      most one is allowed.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationInterpretation in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: ObservationInterpretationNormality
      

      Interpretations of anti-microbial susceptibility testing results
      (microbiology). At most one allowed.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationInterpretation in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: ObservationInterpretationSusceptibility
      

      The observation/test result is interpreted as being outside the inclusion
      range for a particular protocol within which the result is being reported.


                              Example: A positive result on a Hepatitis screening
      test.
                                 Open Issue: EX, HX, LX: These three concepts do not
      seem to meet a clear need in the vocabulary, and their use in observation
      interpretation appears likely to be covered by other existing concepts (e.g.,
      A, H, L).  The only apparent significant difference is their reference to use
      in protocols for exclusion of study subjects.
      These concepts/codes were proposed by RCRIM for use in the CTLaboratory
      message.  They were submitted and approved in the November 2005 Harmonization
      cycle in proposal "030103C_VOCAB_RCRIM_l_quade_RCRIM Obs
      Interp_20051028154455".  However, this proposal was not fully implemented in
      the vocabulary.  The proposal recommended creation of the
      x_ClinicalResearchExclusion domain in ObservationInterpretation with a value
      set including those three concepts/codes, but there is no subdomain of that
      name or equivalent with a binding to either of the value sets that contain
      these concepts/codes.
      Members of the OO WG have recently attempted to contact members of RCRIM
      regarding these concepts, both by email and at the recent WGM in Atlanta,
      without response.  It is felt by OO that the best course of action to take at
      this time is to add this comprehensive Open Issue rather than deprecate these
      three concepts at this time, until further discussion is held.

      Hold for Medical Review


                                 Usage Note: This code is not intended for use in V3
      artifacts.  It is included in the code system to maintain alignment with the
      V2 Table 0078 "Interpretation Codes."
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationInterpretation in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: HoldForMedicalReview
      

      Interpretations of the presence or absence of a component / analyte or
      organism in a test or of a sign in a clinical observation. In keeping with
      laboratory data processing practice, these concepts provide a categorical
      interpretation of the "meaning" of the quantitative value for the same
      observation.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationInterpretation in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: ObservationInterpretationDetection
      

      Interpretation of the observed result taking into account additional
      information (contraindicators) about the patient's situation. Concepts in this
      category are mutually exclusive, i.e., at most one is allowed.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationInterpretation in v3-codesystems.xml

      Interpretation qualifiers in separate OBX segments


                                 Usage Note: This code is not intended for use in V3
      artifacts.  It is included in the code system to maintain alignment with the
      V2 Table 0078 "Interpretation Codes."

   .. attribute:: InterpretationQualifiersInSeparateOBXSegments
      

      Interpretations of the presence and level of reactivity of the specified
      component / analyte with the reagent in the performed laboratory test.
