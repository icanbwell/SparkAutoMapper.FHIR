.. py:class:: TemplateStatusCodeLifeCycleCodeValues

   Design is under development (nascent).
   From: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.1937.98.5.8 in valuesets.xml

   .. py:attribute:: Draft
      

      Design is completed and is being reviewed.
      From: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.1937.98.5.8 in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: UnderPre_publicationReview
      

      Design has been deemed fit for the intended purpose and is published by the
      governance group.
      From: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.1937.98.5.8 in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Active
      

      Design is active, but is under review. The review may result in a change to
      the design. The change may necessitate a new version to be created. This in
      turn may result in the prior version of the template to be retired.
      Alternatively, the review may result in a change to the design that does not
      require a new version to be created, or it may result in no change to the
      design at all.
      From: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.1937.98.5.8 in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: InReview
      

      A drafted design is determined to be erroneous or not fit for intended purpose
      and is discontinued before ever being published in an active state.
      From: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.1937.98.5.8 in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Cancelled
      

      A previously drafted design is determined to be erroneous or not fit for
      intended purpose and is discontinued before ever being published for
      consideration in a pending state.
      From: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.1937.98.5.8 in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Rejected
      

      A previously active design is discontinued from use. It should no longer be
      used for future designs, but for historical purposes may be used to process
      data previously recorded using this design. A newer design may or may not
      exist. The design is published in the retired state.
      From: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.1937.98.5.8 in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Retired
      

      A design is determined to be erroneous or not fit for the intended purpose and
      should no longer be used, even for historical purposes. No new designs can be
      developed for this template. The associated template no longer needs to be
      published, but if published, is shown in the terminated state.
      From: urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.1937.98.5.8 in valuesets.xml
