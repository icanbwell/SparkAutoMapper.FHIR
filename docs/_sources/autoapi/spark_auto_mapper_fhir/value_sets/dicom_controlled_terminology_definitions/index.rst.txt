      either ductal hyperplasia (also called duct epithelial hyperplasia) or lobular
      hyperplasia. Based on the pattern of the cells, hyperplasia may be called
      usual or atypical. In usual hyperplasia, the pattern of cells is very close to
      normal. Atypical hyperplasia (or hyperplasia with atypia) is a term used when
      the cells are more distorted. FROM:

      Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-
      producing glands (lobules) of the breast. Invasive cancer means the cancer
      cells have broken out of the lobule where they began and have the potential to
      spread to the lymph nodes and other areas of the body. Invasive lobular
      carcinoma typically doesn't form a lump, which is common in breast cancer.
      Instead, there is a change in the breast that feels like a thickening or
      fullness in one part of the breast and is different from the surrounding
      breast tissue. FROM: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/invasive-

      Threshold test algorithm that determines a patient's sensitivity at each test
      point in the threshold test pattern by adjusting intensity by 4 dB steps until
      the patient changes their response, and then adjusts the intensity in the
      opposite direction by 2 dB steps until the patient changes their response
      again. The last stimulus seen by the patient is recognized as the threshold
      for that point. The starting values are determined by first thresholding a
      "primary" point in each quadrant then using the results of each primary point
      to determine the starting values for neighboring points

      Traditional full threshold staircase strategy. Initial intensities are
      presented, based on anchor point sensitivities in each quadrant and based on
      already known neighboring sensitivities. In a first run, thresholds are
      changed in 4dB steps until the first response reversal. Then the threshold is
      changed in 2 dB steps until the second response reversal. The threshold is
      calculated as the average between the last seen and last not-seen stimulus,
      supposed to correspond with the 50% point in the frequency-of-seeing curve

      velocity at the orifice, and α is the angle in radians of the constant
      velocity surface. Estimated Orifice area = Flow rate / vp , where vp is the
      peak velocity at the orifice and the flow rate is the PISA peak flow rate. The
