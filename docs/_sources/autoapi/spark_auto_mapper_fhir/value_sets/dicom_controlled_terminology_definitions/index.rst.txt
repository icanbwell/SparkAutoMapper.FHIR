      the detector; 2) "cone cut", in which the X-Ray field does not adequately
      cover the anatomy of interest; 3) detector's sensitive surface is too small to
      cover the projection of the anatomy of interest; 4) improper angular
      orientation or "rotation" of anatomy of interest with respect to the X-Ray

      Hyperplasia is also known as epithelial hyperplasia or proliferative breast
      disease. It's an overgrowth of the cells that line the ducts or the lobules.
      Based on how the cells look under a microscope, the hyperplasia is called
      either ductal hyperplasia (also called duct epithelial hyperplasia) or lobular
      hyperplasia. Based on the pattern of the cells, hyperplasia may be called
      usual or atypical. In usual hyperplasia, the pattern of cells is very close to
      normal. Atypical hyperplasia (or hyperplasia with atypia) is a term used when
      the cells are more distorted. FROM:

      mean there is an increased chance of cancer developing at the site.

      Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-
      producing glands (lobules) of the breast. Invasive cancer means the cancer
      cells have broken out of the lobule where they began and have the potential to
      spread to the lymph nodes and other areas of the body. Invasive lobular
      carcinoma typically doesn't form a lump, which is common in breast cancer.
      Instead, there is a change in the breast that feels like a thickening or
      fullness in one part of the breast and is different from the surrounding
      breast tissue. FROM: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/invasive-

      Threshold test algorithm that determines a patient's sensitivity at each test
      point in the threshold test pattern by adjusting intensity by 4 dB steps until

      opposite direction by 2 dB steps until the patient changes their response
      again. The last stimulus seen by the patient is recognized as the threshold
      for that point. The starting values are determined by first thresholding a
      "primary" point in each quadrant then using the results of each primary point

      Utilizes aliasing velocity (by color Doppler) of flow into an orifice (often

      flow volume. The instantaneous flow rate = (2πr2vav ) * (α / π) where vav is
      the constant velocity known as aliasing velocity at radius r, vp is the peak
      velocity at the orifice, and α is the angle in radians of the constant
      velocity surface. Estimated Orifice area = Flow rate / vp , where vp is the
      peak velocity at the orifice and the flow rate is the PISA peak flow rate. The
      volume flow is then the product of the orifice area and Velocity Time Integral
