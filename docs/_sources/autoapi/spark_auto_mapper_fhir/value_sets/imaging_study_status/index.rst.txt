       The status of the ImagingStudy.

      :annotation: :spark_auto_mapper_fhir.fhir_types.uri.FhirUri = http://hl7.org/fhir/imagingstudy-status

      


.. py:class:: ImagingStudyStatusCodeValues

   The existence of the imaging study is registered, but there is nothing yet
   available.
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/imagingstudy-status in valuesets.xml

   .. py:attribute:: Registered
      

      At least one instance has been associated with this imaging study.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/imagingstudy-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Available
      

      The imaging study is unavailable because the imaging study was not started or
      not completed (also sometimes called "aborted").
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/imagingstudy-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Cancelled
      

      The imaging study has been withdrawn following a previous final release.  This
      electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-
      world decisions were based on it. (If real-world activity has occurred, the
      status should be "cancelled" rather than "entered-in-error".).
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/imagingstudy-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: EnteredInError
      

      The system does not know which of the status values currently applies for this
      request. Note: This concept is not to be used for "other" - one of the listed
      statuses is presumed to apply, it's just not known which one.
