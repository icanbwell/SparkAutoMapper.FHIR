       MedicationRequest Status Codes

   .. attribute:: codeset
      :annotation: :FhirUri = http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/medicationrequest-status

      


.. class:: MedicationrequestStatusCodeValues

   The prescription is 'actionable', but not all actions that are implied by it
   have occurred yet.
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/medicationrequest-status in valuesets.xml

   .. attribute:: Active
      

      Actions implied by the prescription are to be temporarily halted, but are
      expected to continue later.  May also be called 'suspended'.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/medicationrequest-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: OnHold
      

      The prescription has been withdrawn before any administrations have occurred
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/medicationrequest-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Cancelled
      

      All actions that are implied by the prescription have occurred.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/medicationrequest-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Completed
      

      Some of the actions that are implied by the medication request may have
      occurred.  For example, the medication may have been dispensed and the patient
      may have taken some of the medication.  Clinical decision support systems
      should take this status into account
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/medicationrequest-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: EnteredInError
      

      Actions implied by the prescription are to be permanently halted, before all
      of the administrations occurred. This should not be used if the original order
      was entered in error
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/medicationrequest-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Stopped
      

      The prescription is not yet 'actionable', e.g. it is a work in progress,
      requires sign-off, verification or needs to be run through decision support
      process.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/medicationrequest-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Draft
      

      The authoring/source system does not know which of the status values currently
      applies for this observation. Note: This concept is not to be used for 'other'
      - one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply, but the authoring/source
      system does not know which.
