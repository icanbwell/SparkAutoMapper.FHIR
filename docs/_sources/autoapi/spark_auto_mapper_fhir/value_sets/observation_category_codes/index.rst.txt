   Social History Observations define the patient's occupational, personal (e.g.,
   lifestyle), social, familial, and environmental history and health risk
   factors that may impact the patient's health.

   .. attribute:: SocialHistory
      

      Clinical observations measure the body's basic functions such as blood
      pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, height, weight, body mass index, head
      circumference, pulse oximetry, temperature, and body surface area.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: VitalSigns
      

      Observations generated by imaging. The scope includes observations regarding
      plain x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, angiography, echocardiography, and nuclear
      medicine.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Imaging
      

      The results of observations generated by laboratories.  Laboratory results are
      typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such
      as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology
      (including digital pathology), microbiology, and/or virology. These
      observations are based on analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and
      submitted to the laboratory.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Laboratory
      

      Observations generated by other procedures.  This category includes
      observations resulting from interventional and non-interventional procedures
      excluding laboratory and imaging (e.g., cardiology catheterization, endoscopy,
      electrodiagnostics, etc.).  Procedure results are typically generated by a
      clinician to provide more granular information about component observations
      made during a procedure.  An example would be when a gastroenterologist
      reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Procedure
      

      Assessment tool/survey instrument observations (e.g., Apgar Scores, Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)).
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Survey
      

      Observations generated by physical exam findings including direct observations
      made by a clinician and use of simple instruments and the result of simple
      maneuvers performed directly on the patient's body.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Exam
      

      Observations generated by non-interventional treatment protocols (e.g.
      occupational, physical, radiation, nutritional and medication therapy)
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Therapy
      

      Observations that measure or record any bodily activity that enhances or
      maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.  Not under direct
      supervision of practitioner such as a physical therapist. (e.g., laps swum,
      steps, sleep data)
