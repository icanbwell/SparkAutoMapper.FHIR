.. py:class:: ExtraActivityTypeCodeValues

   Activity resulting in a structured collection of preexisting content that does
   not necessarily result in an integral object with semantic context making it
   more than the sum of component parts, from which components could be
   disaggregated without loss of semantic context, e.g., the assembly of multiple
   stand-alone documents.
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/extra-activity-type in valuesets.xml

   .. py:attribute:: Aggregate
      

      Activity resulting in the structured compilation of new and preexisting
      content for the purposes of forming an integral object with  semantic context
      making it more than the sum of component parts, which would be lost if
      decomposed. For example, the composition of a document that includes in whole
      or part other documents along with new content that result in a new document
      that has unique semantic meaning.

   .. py:attribute:: Compose
      

      The means used to associate a set of security attributes with a specific
      information object as part of the data structure for that object. [ISO-10181-3
