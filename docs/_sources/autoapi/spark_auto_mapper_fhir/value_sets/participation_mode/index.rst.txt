   v3.ParticipationMode
   From: http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ParticipationMode in v3-codesystems.xml
        A set of codes specifying the modality by which the Entity playing the Role
   is participating in the Act.  Examples:
   Physically present, over the telephone, written communication.  Rationale:
   Particularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify
   whether the information represented by the act was initially provided
   verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.  Open Issue:
   There needs to be a reexamination of the hierarchies as there seems to be some
   muddling between ELECTRONIC and other concepts that involve electronic
   communication that are in other hierarchies.
