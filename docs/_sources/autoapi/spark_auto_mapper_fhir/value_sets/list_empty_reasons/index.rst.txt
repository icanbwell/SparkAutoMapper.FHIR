       General reasons for a list to be empty. Reasons are either related to a
   summary list (i.e. problem or medication list) or to a workflow related list

.. py:class:: ListEmptyReasonsCodeValues

   Clinical judgment that there are no known items for this list after reasonable
   investigation. Note that this a positive statement by a clinical user, and not
   a default position asserted by a computer system in the lack of other
   information. Example uses:  * For allergies: the patient or patient's
   agent/guardian has asserted that he/she is not aware of any allergies (NKA -
   nil known allergies)  * For medications: the patient or patient's
   agent/guardian has asserted that the patient is known to be taking no
   medications  * For diagnoses, problems and procedures: the patient or
   patient's agent/guardian has asserted that there is no known event to record.
