   v3.IdentifierScope
   From: http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-IdentifierScope in v3-codesystems.xml
         Description:
   Codes to specify the scope in which the identifier applies to the object with
   which it is associated, and used in the datatype property II.

.. class:: IdentifierScopeValues

   Description: An identifier whose scope is defined by the business practices
   associated with the object. In contrast to the other scope identifiers, the
   scope of the use of the id is not necessarily restricted to a single object,
   but may be reused for other objects closely associated with the object due to
   business practice.
   From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-IdentifierScope in v3-codesystems.xml

   .. attribute:: BusinessIdentifier
      

      Description: The identifier associated with a particular object. It remains
      consistent as the object undergoes state transitions.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-IdentifierScope in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: ObjectIdentifier
      

      Description: An identifier that references a particular object as it existed
      at a given point in time. The identifier SHALL change with each state
      transition on the object. I.e. The version identifier of an object prior to a
      'suspend' state transition is distinct from the identifier of the object after
      the state transition. Each version identifier can be tied to exactly one
      ControlAct event which brought that version into being (though the control act
      may never be instantiated).


                                  NOTE: Applications that do not support versioning
      of objects must ignore and not persist these ids to avoid confusion resulting
      from leaving the same identifier on an object that undergoes changes.

   .. attribute:: VersionIdentifier
      

      Description: An identifier that references a particular object as it existed
      at a given point in time. The identifier SHALL change with each state
      transition on the object.


                                 Example The version identifier of an object prior
      to a 'suspend' state transition is distinct from the identifier of the object
      after the state transition. Each version identifier can be tied to exactly one
      ControlAct event which brought that version into being (though the control act
      may never be instantiated).


                                  NOTE: Applications that do not support versioning
      of objects must ignore and not persist these ids to avoid confusion resulting
