   SupplyRequestStatus
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/supplyrequest-status in valuesets.xml
       Status of the supply request.

   .. attribute:: codeset
      :annotation: :FhirUri = http://hl7.org/fhir/supplyrequest-status

      


.. class:: SupplyRequestStatusCodeValues

   The request has been created but is not yet complete or ready for action.
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/supplyrequest-status in valuesets.xml

   .. attribute:: Draft
      

      The request is ready to be acted upon.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/supplyrequest-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Active
      

      The authorization/request to act has been temporarily withdrawn but is
      expected to resume in the future.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/supplyrequest-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Suspended
      

      The authorization/request to act has been terminated prior to the full
      completion of the intended actions.  No further activity should occur.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/supplyrequest-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Cancelled
      

      Activity against the request has been sufficiently completed to the
      satisfaction of the requester.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/supplyrequest-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Completed
      

      This electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that
      real-world decisions were based on it.  (If real-world activity has occurred,
      the status should be "cancelled" rather than "entered-in-error".).
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/supplyrequest-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: EnteredInError
      

      The authoring/source system does not know which of the status values currently
      applies for this observation. Note: This concept is not to be used for "other"
      - one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply, but the authoring/source
      system does not know which.
