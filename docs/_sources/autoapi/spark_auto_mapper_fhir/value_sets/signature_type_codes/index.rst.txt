   SignatureTypeCodes
   From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml
       The Digital Signature Purposes, an indication of the reason an entity signs a
   document. This is included in the signed information and can be used when
   determining accountability for various actions concerning the document.
   Examples include: author, transcriptionist/recorder, and witness.

.. class:: SignatureTypeCodesCodeValues

   the signature of the primary or sole author of a health information document.
   There can be only one primary author of a health information document.
   From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml

   .. attribute:: Author_sSignature
      

      the signature of a health information document coauthor. There can be multiple
      coauthors of a health information document.
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Coauthor_sSignature
      

      the signature of an individual who is a participant in the health information
      document but is not an author or coauthor. (Example a surgeon who is required
      by institutional, regulatory, or legal rules to sign an operative report, but
      who was not involved in the authorship of that report.)

   .. attribute:: Co_participant_sSignature
      

      the signature of an individual who has transcribed a dictated document or
      recorded written text into a digital machine readable format.
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Transcriptionist_RecorderSignature
      

      a signature verifying the information contained in a document. (Example a
      physician is required to countersign a verbal order that has previously been
      recorded in the medical record by a registered nurse who has carried out the
      verbal order.)
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: VerificationSignature
      

      a signature validating a health information document for inclusion in the
      patient record. (Example a medical student or resident is credentialed to
      perform history or physical examinations and to write progress notes. The
      attending physician signs the history and physical examination to validate the
      entry for inclusion in the patient's medical record.)
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: ValidationSignature
      

      the signature of an individual consenting to what is described in a health
      information document.
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: ConsentSignature
      

      the signature of a witness to any other signature.
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: SignatureWitnessSignature
      

      the signature of a witness to an event. (Example the witness has observed a
      procedure and is attesting to this fact.)
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: EventWitnessSignature
      

      the signature of an individual who has witnessed another individual who is
      known to them signing a document. (Example the identity witness is a notary
      public.)
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: IdentityWitnessSignature
      

      the signature of an individual who has witnessed the health care provider
      counselling a patient.
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: ConsentWitnessSignature
      

      the signature of an individual who has translated health care information
      during an event or the obtaining of consent to a treatment.
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: InterpreterSignature
      

      the signature of a person, device, or algorithm that has reviewed or filtered
      data for inclusion into the patient record. ( Examples: (1) a medical records
      clerk who scans a document for inclusion in the medical record, enters header
      information, or catalogues and classifies the data, or a combination thereof;
      (2) a gateway that receives data from another computer system and interprets
      that data or changes its format, or both, before entering it into the patient
      record.)
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: ReviewSignature
      

      the signature of an automated data source. (Examples: (1) the signature for an
      image that is generated by a device for inclusion in the patient record; (2)
      the signature for an ECG derived by an ECG system for inclusion in the patient
      record; (3) the data from a biomedical monitoring device or system that is for
      inclusion in the patient record.)
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: SourceSignature
      

      the signature on a new amended document of an individual who has corrected,
      edited, or amended an original health information document. An addendum
      signature can either be a signature type or a signature sub-type (see 8.1).
      Any document with an addendum signature shall have a companion document that
      is the original document with its original, unaltered content, and original
      signatures. The original document shall be referenced via an attribute in the
      new document, which contains, for example, the digest of the old document.
      Whether the original, unaltered, document is always displayed with the
      addended document is a local matter, but the original, unaltered, document
      must remain as part of the patient record and be retrievable on demand.
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: AddendumSignature
      

      the signature on an original document of an individual who has generated a new
      amended document. This (original) document shall reference the new document
      via an additional signature purpose. This is the inverse of an addendum
      signature and provides a pointer from the original to the amended document.
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: ModificationSignature
      

      the signature of an individual who is certifying that the document is
      invalidated by an error(s), or is placed in the wrong chart. An administrative
      (error/edit) signature must include an addendum to the document and therefore
      shall have an addendum signature sub-type (see 8.1). This signature is
      reserved for the highest health information system administrative
      classification, since it is a statement that the entire document is
      invalidated by the error and that the document should no longer be used for
      patient care, although for legal reasons the document must remain part of the
      permanent patient record.
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Administrative_Error_Edit_Signature
      

      the signature by an entity or device trusted to provide accurate timestamps.
      This timestamp might be provided, for example, in the signature time
      attribute.
      From: urn:iso-astm:E1762-95:2013 in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: TimestampSignature
