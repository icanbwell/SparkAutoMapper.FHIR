.. class:: MedicationDispenseStatusCodesCodeValues

   The core event has not started yet, but some staging activities have begun
   (e.g. initial compounding or packaging of medication). Preparation stages may
   be tracked for billing purposes.

   .. attribute:: Preparation
      

      The dispensed product is ready for pickup.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/medicationdispense-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: InProgress
      

      The dispensed product was not and will never be picked up by the patient.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/medicationdispense-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Cancelled
      

      The dispense process is paused while waiting for an external event to
      reactivate the dispense.  For example, new stock has arrived or the prescriber
      has called.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/medicationdispense-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: OnHold
      

      The dispensed product has been picked up.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/medicationdispense-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Completed
      

      The dispense was entered in error and therefore nullified.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/medicationdispense-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: EnteredInError
      

      Actions implied by the dispense have been permanently halted, before all of
      them occurred.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/medicationdispense-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Stopped
      

      The dispense was declined and not performed.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/medicationdispense-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Declined
      

      The authoring system does not know which of the status values applies for this
      medication dispense.  Note: this concept is not to be used for other - one of
      the listed statuses is presumed to apply, it's just now known which one.
