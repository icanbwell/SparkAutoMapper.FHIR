.. py:class:: RequestStatusCodeValues

   The request has been created but is not yet complete or ready for action.
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/request-status in valuesets.xml

   .. py:attribute:: Draft
      

      The request is in force and ready to be acted upon.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/request-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Active
      

      The request (and any implicit authorization to act) has been temporarily
      withdrawn but is expected to resume in the future.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/request-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: OnHold
      

      The request (and any implicit authorization to act) has been terminated prior
      to the known full completion of the intended actions.  No further activity
      should occur.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/request-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Revoked
      

      The activity described by the request has been fully performed.  No further
      activity will occur.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/request-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Completed
      

      This request should never have existed and should be considered 'void'.  (It
      is possible that real-world decisions were based on it.  If real-world
      activity has occurred, the status should be "revoked" rather than "entered-in-
      error".).
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/request-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: EnteredInError
      

      The authoring/source system does not know which of the status values currently
      applies for this request.  Note: This concept is not to be used for "other" -
      one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply,  but the authoring/source
      system does not know which.
