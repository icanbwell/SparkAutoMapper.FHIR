   DiagnosticReportStatus
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-report-status in valuesets.xml
       The status of the diagnostic report.

   .. attribute:: codeset
      :annotation: :FhirUri = http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-report-status

      


.. class:: DiagnosticReportStatusCodeValues

   The existence of the report is registered, but there is nothing yet available.
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-report-status in valuesets.xml

   .. attribute:: Registered
      

      This is a partial (e.g. initial, interim or preliminary) report: data in the
      report may be incomplete or unverified.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-report-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Partial
      

      The report is complete and verified by an authorized person.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-report-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Final
      

      Subsequent to being final, the report has been modified.  This includes any
      change in the results, diagnosis, narrative text, or other content of a report
      that has been issued.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-report-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Amended
      

      The report is unavailable because the measurement was not started or not
      completed (also sometimes called "aborted").
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-report-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Cancelled
      

      The report has been withdrawn following a previous final release.  This
      electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-
      world decisions were based on it. (If real-world activity has occurred, the
      status should be "cancelled" rather than "entered-in-error".).
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-report-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: EnteredInError
      

      The authoring/source system does not know which of the status values currently
      applies for this observation. Note: This concept is not to be used for "other"
      - one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply, but the authoring/source
      system does not know which.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/diagnostic-report-status in valuesets.xml
