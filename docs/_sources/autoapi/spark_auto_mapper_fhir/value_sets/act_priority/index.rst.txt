   .. py:attribute:: CallbackResults
      

      Filler should contact the placer (or target) to schedule the service.  (Was
      "C" in HL7 version 2.3's TQ-priority component.)

   .. py:attribute:: Emergency
      

      Used to indicate that a service is to be performed prior to a scheduled
      surgery.  When ordering a service and using the pre-op priority, a check is
      done to see the amount of time that must be allowed for performance of the
      service.  When the order is placed, a message can be generated indicating the
      time needed for the service so that it is not ordered in conflict with a
      scheduled operation.
