   FHIR Defined Concept Properties
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties in valuesets.xml
       A set of common concept properties for use on coded systems throughout the
   FHIR eco-system.

   .. py:attribute:: codeset
      :annotation: :spark_auto_mapper_fhir.fhir_types.uri.FhirUri = http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties

      


.. py:class:: FHIRDefinedConceptPropertiesCodeValues

   True if the concept is not considered active - e.g. not a valid concept any
   more. Property type is boolean, default value is false
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties in valuesets.xml

   .. py:attribute:: Inactive
      

      The date at which a concept was deprecated. Concepts that are deprecated but
      not inactive can still be used, but their use is discouraged, and they should
      be expected to be made inactive in a future release. Property type is dateTime
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Deprecated
      

      The concept is not intended to be chosen by the user - only intended to be
      used as a selector for other concepts. Note, though, that the interpretation
      of this is highly contextual; all concepts are selectable in some context.
      Property type is boolean
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: NotSelectable
      

      The concept identified in this property is a parent of the concept on which it
      is a property. The property type will be 'code'. The meaning of 'parent' is
      defined by the hierarchyMeaning attribute
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Parent
      

      The concept identified in this property is a child of the concept on which it
      is a property. The property type will be 'code'. The meaning of 'child' is
      defined by the hierarchyMeaning attribute
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Child
