   EventStatus
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/event-status in valuesets.xml
       Codes identifying the lifecycle stage of an event.

.. class:: EventStatusCodeValues

   The core event has not started yet, but some staging activities have begun
   (e.g. surgical suite preparation).  Preparation stages may be tracked for
   billing purposes.
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/event-status in valuesets.xml

   .. attribute:: Preparation
      

      The event is currently occurring.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/event-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: InProgress
      

      The event was terminated prior to any activity beyond preparation.  I.e. The
      'main' activity has not yet begun.  The boundary between preparatory and the
      'main' activity is context-specific.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/event-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: NotDone
      

      The event has been temporarily stopped but is expected to resume in the
      future.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/event-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: OnHold
      

      The event was terminated prior to the full completion of the intended activity
      but after at least some of the 'main' activity (beyond preparation) has
      occurred.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/event-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Stopped
      

      The event has now concluded.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/event-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Completed
      

      This electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that
      real-world decisions were based on it.  (If real-world activity has occurred,
      the status should be "stopped" rather than "entered-in-error".).
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/event-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: EnteredInError
      

      The authoring/source system does not know which of the status values currently
      applies for this event.  Note: This concept is not to be used for "other" -
      one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply,  but the authoring/source
      system does not know which.

   .. attribute:: Unknown
