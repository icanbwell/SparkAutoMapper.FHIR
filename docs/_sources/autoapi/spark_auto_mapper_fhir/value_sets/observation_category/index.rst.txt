.. class:: ObservationCategoryValues

   Observations generated by physical exam findings including direct observations
   made by a clinician and use of simple instruments and the result of simple
   maneuvers performed directly on the patient's body.
   From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationCategory in v3-codesystems.xml

   .. attribute:: Exam
      

      Observations generated by imaging. The scope includes observations, plain
      x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, angiography, echocardiography, nuclear medicine.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationCategory in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: Imaging
      

      The results of observations generated by laboratories. Laboratory results are
      typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such
      as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology,
      microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of
      specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationCategory in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: Laboratory
      

      Observations generated by other procedures. This category includes
      observations resulting from interventional and non-interventional procedures
      excluding lab and imaging (e.g. cardiology catheterization, endoscopy,
      electrodiagnostics, etc.). Procedure results are typically generated by a
      clinician to provide more granular information about component observations
      made during a procedure, such as where a gastroenterologist reports the size
      of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationCategory in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: Procedure
      

      The Social History Observations define the patient's occupational, personal
      (e.g. lifestyle), social, and environmental history and health risk factors,
      as well as administrative data such as marital status, race, ethnicity and
      religious affiliation.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationCategory in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: SocialHistory
      

      Assessment tool/survey instrument observations (e.g. Apgar Scores, Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA))
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationCategory in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: Survey
      

      Observations generated by non-interventional treatment protocols (e.g.
      occupational, physical, radiation, nutritional and medication therapy)
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationCategory in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. attribute:: Therapy
      

      Clinical observations measure the body's basic functions such as such as blood
      pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, height, weight, body mass index, head
      circumference, pulse oximetry, temperature, and body surface area.
