.. py:class:: DocumentCompletionValues

   A completion status in which a document has been signed manually or
   electronically by one or more individuals who attest to its accuracy.  No
   explicit determination is made that the assigned individual has performed the
   authentication.  While the standard allows multiple instances of
   authentication, it would be typical to have a single instance of
   authentication, usually by the assigned individual.
   From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-DocumentCompletion in v3-codesystems.xml

   .. py:attribute:: Authenticated
      

      A completion status in which information has been orally recorded but not yet
      transcribed.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-DocumentCompletion in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Dictated
      

      A completion status in which document content, other than dictation, has been
      received but has not been translated into the final electronic format.
      Examples include paper documents, whether hand-written or typewritten, and
      intermediate electronic forms, such as voice to text.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-DocumentCompletion in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Documented
      

      A completion status in which information is known to be missing from a
      transcribed document.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-DocumentCompletion in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Incomplete
      

      A workflow status where the material has been assigned to personnel to perform
      the task of transcription. The document remains in this state until the
      document is transcribed.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-DocumentCompletion in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: InProgress
      

      A completion status in which a document has been signed manually or
      electronically by the individual who is legally responsible for that document.
      This is the most mature state in the workflow progression.

      the wrong chart. The document is no longer available.

   .. py:attribute:: NullifiedDocument
      

      A completion status in which a document is transcribed but not authenticated.

      that the document will be signed.
