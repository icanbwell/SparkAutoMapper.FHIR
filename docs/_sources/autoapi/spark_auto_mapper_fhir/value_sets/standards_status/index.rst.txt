   This portion of the specification is not considered to be complete enough or
   sufficiently reviewed to be safe for implementation. It may have known issues
   or still be in the "in development" stage. It is included in the publication
   as a place-holder, to solicit feedback from the implementation community
   and/or to give implementers some insight as to functionality likely to be
   included in future versions of the specification. Content at this level should
   only be implemented by the brave or desperate and is very much "use at your
   own risk". The content that is Draft that will usually be elevated to Trial
   Use once review and correction is complete after it has been subjected to
   ballot.

   .. attribute:: Draft
      

      This content has been subject to review and production implementation in a
      wide variety of environments. The content is considered to be stable and has
      been 'locked', subjecting it to FHIR Inter-version Compatibility Rules. While
      changes are possible, they are expected to be infrequent and are tightly
      constrained. Compatibility Rules.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/standards-status in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Normative
      

      This content has been well reviewed and is considered by the authors to be
      ready for use in production systems. It has been subjected to ballot and
      approved as an official standard. However, it has not yet seen widespread use
      in production across the full spectrum of environments it is intended to be
      used in. In some cases, there may be documented known issues that require
      implementation experience to determine appropriate resolutions for.

      Future versions of FHIR may make significant changes to Trial Use content that
      are not compatible with previously published content.

      This portion of the specification is provided for implementer assistance, and
      does not make rules that implementers are required to follow. Typical examples
      of this content in the FHIR specification are tables of contents, registries,
      examples, and implementer advice.

   .. attribute:: Informative

      does not make rules that implementers are required to follow. Typical examples

   .. attribute:: Deprecated
      

      This is content that is managed outside the FHIR Specification, but included
      for implementer convenience.
