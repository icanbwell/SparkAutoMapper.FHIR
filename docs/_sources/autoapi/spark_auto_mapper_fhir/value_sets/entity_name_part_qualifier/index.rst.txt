.. py:class:: EntityNamePartQualifierCodeValues

   Description:A name part a person acquired.  The name part may be acquired by
   adoption, or the person may have chosen to use the name part for some other
   reason.


                              Note: this differs from an Other/Psuedonym/Alias in
   that an acquired name part is acquired on a formal basis rather than an
   informal one (e.g. registered as part of the official name).
   From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-EntityNamePartQualifierR2 in v3-codesystems.xml

   .. py:attribute:: Acquired
      

      Description:A name that a person was given at birth or established as a
      consequence of adoption.


                                 Note: This is not used for temporary names assigned
      at birth such as "Baby of Smith" a" which is just a name with a use code of
      "TEMP".
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-EntityNamePartQualifierR2 in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Birth
      

      Description:Used to indicate which of the various name parts is used when
      interacting with the person.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-EntityNamePartQualifierR2 in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Callme
      

      Description:Indicates that a name part is just an initial.  Initials do not
      imply a trailing period since this would not work with non-Latin scripts.  In
      some languages, initials may consist of more than one letter, e.g., "Ph" could
      stand for "Philippe" or "Th" For "Thomas".
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-EntityNamePartQualifierR2 in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Initial
      

      Description:For organizations a suffix indicating the legal status, e.g.,
      "Inc.", "Co.", "AG", "GmbH", "B.V." "S.A.", "Ltd." etc.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-EntityNamePartQualifierR2 in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: LegalStatus
      

      Description:Indicates that the name part is a middle name.


                                 Usage Notes: In general, the english "middle name"
      concept is all of the given names after the first. This qualifier may be used
      to explicitly indicate which given names are considered to be middle names.
      The middle name qualifier may also be used with family names. This is a
      Scandinavian use case, matching the concept of "mellomnavn","mellannamn". Note
      that there are specific rules that indicate what names may be taken as a
      mellannamn in different Scandinavian countries.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-EntityNamePartQualifierR2 in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: MiddleName
      

      Description:A prefix has a strong association to the immediately following
      name part. A prefix has no implicit trailing white space (it has implicit
      leading white space though).
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-EntityNamePartQualifierR2 in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Prefix
      

      Description: Medication Name Parts are a means of specifying a range of
      acceptable "official" forms of the name of a product.  They are used as
      patterns against which input name strings may be matched for automatic
      identification of products from input text reports.   While they cover the
      concepts held under "doseForm" or "route" or "strength" the name parts are not
      the same and do not fit into a controlled vocabulary in the same way. By
      specifying up to 8 name parts a much larger range of possible names can be
      generated.
