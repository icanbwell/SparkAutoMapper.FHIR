.. py:class:: Hl7PublishingSubSectionValues

   Description: Represents the HL7 V3 publishing sub-section that holds common or
   shared specifications within the Infrastructure Management (IM) section.


                              UsageNote: V3 Specifications are published in a set

   into sub-sections of related health care areas and these sub-sections are
   further aggregated into three major sets.
