   ObservationStatus
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-status in valuesets.xml
       Codes providing the status of an observation.

.. py:class:: ObservationStatusCodeValues

   The existence of the observation is registered, but there is no result yet
   available.
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-status in valuesets.xml

   .. py:attribute:: Registered
      

      This is an initial or interim observation: data may be incomplete or
      unverified.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Preliminary
      

      The observation is complete and there are no further actions needed.
      Additional information such "released", "signed", etc would be represented
      using [Provenance](provenance.html) which provides not only the act but also
      the actors and dates and other related data. These act states would be
      associated with an observation status of `preliminary` until they are all
      completed and then a status of `final` would be applied.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Final
      

      Subsequent to being Final, the observation has been modified subsequent.  This
      includes updates/new information and corrections.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Amended
      

      The observation is unavailable because the measurement was not started or not
      completed (also sometimes called "aborted").
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Cancelled
      

      The observation has been withdrawn following previous final release.  This
      electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-
      world decisions were based on it. (If real-world activity has occurred, the
      status should be "cancelled" rather than "entered-in-error".).
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/observation-status in valuesets.xml


   .. py:attribute:: EnteredInError
      

      The authoring/source system does not know which of the status values currently
      applies for this observation. Note: This concept is not to be used for "other"
      - one of the listed statuses is presumed to apply, but the authoring/source
      system does not know which.
