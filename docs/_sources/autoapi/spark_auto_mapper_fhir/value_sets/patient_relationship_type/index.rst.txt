      Description: A role recognized through the eligibility of an identified party
      for benefits covered under an insurance policy or a program based on meeting
      eligibility criteria.

                              Eligibility as a covered party may be conditioned on
      the party meeting criteria to qualify for coverage under a policy or program,
      which may be mandated by law.  These criteria may be:



                                    The sole basis for coverage, e.g., being
      differently abled may qualify a person for disability coverage



                                    May more fully qualify a covered party role e.g,
      being differently abled may qualify an adult child as a dependent



                                    May impact the level of coverage for a covered
      party under a policy or program, e.g., being differently abled may qualify a
      program eligible for additional benefits.




                                 Discussion:  The Abstract Value Set
      "CoverageRoleType", which was developed for use in the Canadian realm "pre-
      coordinate" coverage roles with other roles that a covered party must play in
      order to be eligible for coverage, e.g., "handicapped dependent".   These
      role.codes may only be used with COVPTY to avoid overlapping concepts that
      would result from using them to specify the specializations of COVPTY, e.g.,
      the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code family dependent
      because that relationship has overlapping concepts due to the role.code
      precoodination and is conveyed in FICO with the personal relationship role
      that has a PART role link to the covered party role.  For the same reasons,
      the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code HANDIC (handicapped
      dependent); the role.code DIFFABLE (differently abled) should be used instead.

                              In summary, the coded concepts in the Abstract Value
      Set "CoveredPartyRoleType" can be "post-coordinated" with the
      "RoleClassCoveredParty" Abstract Value Set.  Decoupling these concepts is
      intended to support an expansive range of covered party concepts and their
      semantic comparability.
