      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: ActContainerRegistrationCode
      

      An observation form that determines parameters or attributes of an Act.
      Examples are the settings of a ventilator machine as parameters of a
      ventilator treatment act; the controls on dillution factors of a chemical
      analyzer as a parameter of a laboratory observation act; the settings of a
      physiologic measurement assembly (e.g., time skew) or the position of the body
      while measuring blood pressure.

                              Control variables are forms of observations because
      just as with clinical observations, the Observation.code determines the
      parameter and the Observation.value assigns the value. While control variables
      sometimes can be observed (by noting the control settings or an actually
      measured feedback loop) they are not primary observations, in the sense that a
      control variable without a primary act is of no use (e.g., it makes no sense
      to record a blood pressure position without recording a blood pressure,
      whereas it does make sense to record a systolic blood pressure without a
      diastolic blood pressure).

   .. py:attribute:: Preliminary
      

      An observation identifying security metadata about an IT resource (data,
      information object, service, or system capability), which may be used to make
      access control decisions.  Security metadata are used to name security labels.


                                 Rationale: According to ISO/TS 22600-3:2009(E)
      A.9.1.7 SECURITY LABEL MATCHING, Security label matching compares the
      initiator's clearance to the target's security label.  All of the following
      must be true for authorization to be granted:


                                 The security policy identifiers shall be identical
                                 The classification level of the initiator shall be
      greater than or equal to that of the target (that is, there shall be at least
      one value in the classification list of the clearance greater than or equal to
      the classification of the target), and
                                 For each security category in the target label,
      there shall be a security category of the same type in the initiator's
      clearance and the initiator's classification level shall dominate that of the
      target.


                                 Examples: SecurityObservationType  security label
      fields include:


                                 Confidentiality classification
                                 Compartment category
                                 Sensitivity category
                                 Security mechanisms used to ensure data integrity
      or to perform authorized data transformation
                                 Indicators of an IT resource completeness,
      veracity, reliability, trustworthiness, or provenance.


                                 Usage Note: SecurityObservationType codes designate
      security label field types, which are valued with an applicable
      SecurityObservationValue code as the "security label tag".

   .. py:attribute:: ActContainerRegistrationCode
      

      An observation form that determines parameters or attributes of an Act.
      Examples are the settings of a ventilator machine as parameters of a
      ventilator treatment act; the controls on dillution factors of a chemical
      analyzer as a parameter of a laboratory observation act; the settings of a
      physiologic measurement assembly (e.g., time skew) or the position of the body
      while measuring blood pressure.

                              Control variables are forms of observations because
      just as with clinical observations, the Observation.code determines the
      parameter and the Observation.value assigns the value. While control variables
      sometimes can be observed (by noting the control settings or an actually
      measured feedback loop) they are not primary observations, in the sense that a
      control variable without a primary act is of no use (e.g., it makes no sense
      to record a blood pressure position without recording a blood pressure,
      whereas it does make sense to record a systolic blood pressure without a
      diastolic blood pressure).

   .. py:attribute:: Preliminary
      

      An observation identifying security metadata about an IT resource (data,
      information object, service, or system capability), which may be used to make
      access control decisions.  Security metadata are used to name security labels.


                                 Rationale: According to ISO/TS 22600-3:2009(E)
      A.9.1.7 SECURITY LABEL MATCHING, Security label matching compares the
      initiator's clearance to the target's security label.  All of the following
      must be true for authorization to be granted:


                                 The security policy identifiers shall be identical
                                 The classification level of the initiator shall be
      greater than or equal to that of the target (that is, there shall be at least
      one value in the classification list of the clearance greater than or equal to
      the classification of the target), and
                                 For each security category in the target label,
      there shall be a security category of the same type in the initiator's
      clearance and the initiator's classification level shall dominate that of the
      target.


                                 Examples: SecurityObservationType  security label
      fields include:


                                 Confidentiality classification
                                 Compartment category
                                 Sensitivity category
                                 Security mechanisms used to ensure data integrity
      or to perform authorized data transformation
                                 Indicators of an IT resource completeness,
      veracity, reliability, trustworthiness, or provenance.


                                 Usage Note: SecurityObservationType codes designate
      security label field types, which are valued with an applicable
      SecurityObservationValue code as the "security label tag".

   .. py:attribute:: Preliminary
      

      An observation identifying security metadata about an IT resource (data,
      information object, service, or system capability), which may be used to make
      access control decisions.  Security metadata are used to name security labels.


                                 Rationale: According to ISO/TS 22600-3:2009(E)
      A.9.1.7 SECURITY LABEL MATCHING, Security label matching compares the
      initiator's clearance to the target's security label.  All of the following
      must be true for authorization to be granted:


                                 The security policy identifiers shall be identical
                                 The classification level of the initiator shall be
      greater than or equal to that of the target (that is, there shall be at least
      one value in the classification list of the clearance greater than or equal to
      the classification of the target), and
                                 For each security category in the target label,
      there shall be a security category of the same type in the initiator's
      clearance and the initiator's classification level shall dominate that of the
      target.


                                 Examples: SecurityObservationType  security label
      fields include:


                                 Confidentiality classification
                                 Compartment category
                                 Sensitivity category
                                 Security mechanisms used to ensure data integrity
      or to perform authorized data transformation
                                 Indicators of an IT resource completeness,
      veracity, reliability, trustworthiness, or provenance.


                                 Usage Note: SecurityObservationType codes designate
      security label field types, which are valued with an applicable
      SecurityObservationValue code as the "security label tag".

   .. py:attribute:: Preliminary
      

      An observation identifying security metadata about an IT resource (data,
      information object, service, or system capability), which may be used to make
      access control decisions.  Security metadata are used to name security labels.


                                 Rationale: According to ISO/TS 22600-3:2009(E)
      A.9.1.7 SECURITY LABEL MATCHING, Security label matching compares the
      initiator's clearance to the target's security label.  All of the following
      must be true for authorization to be granted:


                                 The security policy identifiers shall be identical
                                 The classification level of the initiator shall be
      greater than or equal to that of the target (that is, there shall be at least
      one value in the classification list of the clearance greater than or equal to
      the classification of the target), and
                                 For each security category in the target label,
      there shall be a security category of the same type in the initiator's
      clearance and the initiator's classification level shall dominate that of the
      target.


                                 Examples: SecurityObservationType  security label
      fields include:


                                 Confidentiality classification
                                 Compartment category
                                 Sensitivity category
                                 Security mechanisms used to ensure data integrity
      or to perform authorized data transformation
                                 Indicators of an IT resource completeness,
      veracity, reliability, trustworthiness, or provenance.


                                 Usage Note: SecurityObservationType codes designate
      security label field types, which are valued with an applicable
      SecurityObservationValue code as the "security label tag".

      Definition: A government health program that provides coverage on a fee for
      service basis for health services to persons meeting eligibility criteria such
      as income, location of residence, access to other coverages, health condition,
      and age, the cost of which is to some extent subsidized by public funds.


                                 Discussion: The structure and business processes
      for underwriting and administering a subsidized fee for service program is
      further specified by the Underwriter and Payer Role.class and Role.code.

      administers the program.  Employees may be required to pay premiums toward the
      cost of coverage as well.

      with an Act or a Role to indicate the legal provision to which the assignment
      of an Act.confidentialityCode or Role.confidentialtyCode complies.  May be
      used to further specify rationale for assignment of other ActPrivacyPolicy
      codes in the US realm, e.g., ETH and 42CFRPart2 can be differentiated from ETH
