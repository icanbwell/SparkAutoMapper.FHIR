   CodeSystemContentMode
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-content-mode in valuesets.xml
       The extent of the content of the code system (the concepts and codes it
   defines) are represented in a code system resource.

   .. attribute:: codeset
      :annotation: :FhirUri = http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-content-mode

      


.. class:: CodeSystemContentModeCodeValues

   None of the concepts defined by the code system are included in the code
   system resource.
   From: http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-content-mode in valuesets.xml

   .. attribute:: NotPresent
      

      A few representative concepts are included in the code system resource. There
      is no useful intent in the subset choice and there's no process to make it
      workable: it's not intended to be workable.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-content-mode in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Example
      

      A subset of the code system concepts are included in the code system resource.
      This is a curated subset released for a specific purpose under the governance
      of the code system steward, and that the intent, bounds and consequences of
      the fragmentation are clearly defined in the fragment or the code system
      documentation. Fragments are also known as partitions.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-content-mode in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Fragment
      

      All the concepts defined by the code system are included in the code system
      resource.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-content-mode in valuesets.xml


   .. attribute:: Complete
      

      The resource doesn't define any new concepts; it just provides additional
      designations and properties to another code system.
      From: http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-content-mode in valuesets.xml
