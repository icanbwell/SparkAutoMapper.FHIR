   BasicResourceTypes
   From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/basic-resource-type in valuesets.xml
       This value set defines codes for resources not yet supported by (or which will
   never be supported by) FHIR.  Many of the codes listed here will eventually be
   turned into official resources.  However, there is no guarantee that any
   particular resource will be created nor that the scope will be exactly as
   defined by the codes presented here.  Codes in this set will be deprecated
   if/when formal resources are defined that encompass these concepts.
