.. class:: ActRelationshipSplitValues

   The pre-condition associated with the branch is evaluated once and if true the
   branch may be entered. All other exclusive branches compete with each other
   and only one will be selected. This implements a COND, IF and CASE
   conditionals, or "XOR-split." The order in which the branches are considered
   may be specified in the priorityNumber attribute.
   From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActRelationshipSplit in v3-codesystems.xml

   .. attribute:: ExclusiveTryOnce
      

      A branch is selected as soon as the pre-condition associated with the branch
      evaluates to true.  If the condition is false, the branch may be entered
      later, when the condition turns true.  All other exclusive branches compete
      with each other and only one will be selected.  Each waiting branch executes
      in parallel with the default join code wait  (see below). The order in which
      the branches are considered may be specified in the
      Service_relationship.priority_nmb.

   .. attribute:: ExclusiveWait
      

      A branch is executed if its associated preconditions permit. If associated
      preconditions do not permit, the branch is dropped.  Inclusive branches are
      not suppressed and do not suppress other branches.

   .. attribute:: InclusiveTryOnce
      

      A branch is executed as soon as its associated conditions permit.  If the
      condition is false, the branch may be entered later, when the condition turns
      true.  Inclusive branches are not suppressed and do not suppress other
      branches.  Each waiting branch executes in parallel with the default join code
      wait  (see below).
