.. py:class:: ProbabilityDistributionTypeCodeValues

   The beta-distribution is used for data that is bounded on both sides and may
   or may not be skewed (e.g., occurs when probabilities are estimated.)  Two
   parameters a and b  are available to adjust the curve.  The mean m and
   variance s2 relate as follows: m = a/ (a + b) and s2 = ab/((a + b)2 (a + b +
   1)).

   .. py:attribute:: Beta
      

      Used for data that describes extinction.  The exponential distribution is a
      special form of g-distribution where a = 1, hence, the relationship to mean m
      and variance s2 are m = b and s2 = b2.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ProbabilityDistributionType in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Exponential
      

      Used to describe the quotient of two c2 random variables.  The F-distribution
      has two parameters n1 and n2, which are the numbers of degrees of freedom of
      the numerator and denominator variable respectively. The relationship to mean
      m  and variance s2 are: m = n2 / (n2 - 2) and s2 = (2 n2 (n2 + n1 - 2)) / (n1
      (n2 - 2)2 (n2 - 4)).
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ProbabilityDistributionType in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: F
      

      The gamma-distribution used for data that is skewed and bounded to the right,
      i.e. where the maximum of the distribution curve is located near the origin.
      The g-distribution has a two parameters a and b.  The relationship to mean m
      and variance s2 is m = a b and s2 = a b2.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ProbabilityDistributionType in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Log_normal
      

      This is the well-known bell-shaped normal distribution.  Because of the
      central limit theorem, the normal distribution is the distribution of choice
      for an unbounded random variable that is an outcome of a combination of many
      stochastic processes.  Even for values bounded on a single side (i.e. greater
      than 0) the normal distribution may be accurate enough if the mean is "far
      away" from the bound of the scale measured in terms of standard deviations.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ProbabilityDistributionType in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Normal_Gaussian_
      

      Used to describe the quotient of a normal random variable and the square root
      of a c2 random variable.  The t-distribution has one parameter n, the number
      of degrees of freedom. The relationship to mean m  and variance s2 are: m = 0
      and s2 = n / (n - 2)
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ProbabilityDistributionType in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: T
      

      The uniform distribution assigns a constant probability over the entire
      interval of possible outcomes, while all outcomes outside this interval are
      assumed to have zero probability.  The width of this interval is 2s sqrt(3).
      Thus, the uniform distribution assigns the probability densities f(x) = sqrt(2
      s sqrt(3))  to values m - s sqrt(3) >= x <= m + s sqrt(3) and f(x) = 0
      otherwise.
      From: http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ProbabilityDistributionType in v3-codesystems.xml


   .. py:attribute:: Uniform
      

      Used to describe the sum of squares of random variables which occurs when a
      variance is estimated (rather than presumed) from the sample.  The only
      parameter of the c2-distribution is n, so called the number of degrees of
      freedom (which is the number of independent parts in the sum).  The
      c2-distribution is a special type of g-distribution with parameter a = n /2
      and b  = 2.  Hence, m = n and s2 = 2 n.
