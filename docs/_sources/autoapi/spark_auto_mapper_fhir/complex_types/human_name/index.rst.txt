       A human's name with the ability to identify parts and usage.
       If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the
   defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param use: Identifies the purpose for this name.
       :param text: Specifies the entire name as it should be displayed e.g. on an application UI.
   This may be provided instead of or as well as the specific parts.
       :param family: The part of a name that links to the genealogy. In some cultures (e.g.
   Eritrea) the family name of a son is the first name of his father.
       :param given: Given name.
       :param prefix: Part of the name that is acquired as a title due to academic, legal,
   employment or nobility status, etc. and that appears at the start of the name.
       :param suffix: Part of the name that is acquired as a title due to academic, legal,
   employment or nobility status, etc. and that appears at the end of the name.
       :param period: Indicates the period of time when this name was valid for the named person.
