       An amount of economic utility in some recognized currency.
       If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the
   defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param value: Numerical value (with implicit precision).
       :param currency: ISO 4217 Currency Code.
