   Identifier
   fhir-base.xsd
       An identifier - identifies some entity uniquely and unambiguously. Typically this is used for business identifiers.
       If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

       An identifier - identifies some entity uniquely and unambiguously. Typically
   this is used for business identifiers.
       If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the
   defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param use: The purpose of this identifier.
       :param type_: A coded type for the identifier that can be used to determine which identifier
   to use for a specific purpose.
       :param system: Establishes the namespace for the value - that is, a URL that describes a set
   values that are unique.
       :param value: The portion of the identifier typically relevant to the user and which is
   unique within the context of the system.
       :param period: Time period during which identifier is/was valid for use.
       :param assigner: Organization that issued/manages the identifier.
