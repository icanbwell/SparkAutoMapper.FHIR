       Details for all kinds of technology mediated contact points for a person or
   organization, including telephone, email, etc.
       If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the
   defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param system: Telecommunications form for contact point - what communications system is
   required to make use of the contact.
       :param value: The actual contact point details, in a form that is meaningful to the
   designated communication system (i.e. phone number or email address).
       :param use: Identifies the purpose for the contact point.
       :param rank: Specifies a preferred order in which to use a set of contacts. ContactPoints
   with lower rank values are more preferred than those with higher rank values.
       :param period: Time period when the contact point was/is in use.
