   Duration
   fhir-base.xsd
       A length of time.
       If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

       A length of time.
       If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the
   defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param value: The value of the measured amount. The value includes an implicit precision in
   the presentation of the value.
       :param comparator: How the value should be understood and represented - whether the actual value
   is greater or less than the stated value due to measurement issues; e.g. if
   the comparator is "<" , then the real value is < stated value.
       :param unit: A human-readable form of the unit.
       :param system: The identification of the system that provides the coded form of the unit.
       :param code: A computer processable form of the unit in some unit representation system.
