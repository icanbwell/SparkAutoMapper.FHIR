       :param comparator: How the value should be understood and represented - whether the actual value
   is greater or less than the stated value due to measurement issues; e.g. if
   the comparator is "<" , then the real value is < stated value.
       :param unit: A human-readable form of the unit.
       :param system: The identification of the system that provides the coded form of the unit.
       :param code: A computer processable form of the unit in some unit representation system.
