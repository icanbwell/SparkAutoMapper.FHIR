   SampledData
   fhir-base.xsd
       A series of measurements taken by a device, with upper and lower limits. There may be more than one dimension in the data.
       If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

       A series of measurements taken by a device, with upper and lower limits. There
   may be more than one dimension in the data.
       If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the
   defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param origin: The base quantity that a measured value of zero represents. In addition, this
   provides the units of the entire measurement series.
       :param period: The length of time between sampling times, measured in milliseconds.
       :param factor: A correction factor that is applied to the sampled data points before they are
   added to the origin.
       :param lowerLimit: The lower limit of detection of the measured points. This is needed if any of
   the data points have the value "L" (lower than detection limit).
       :param upperLimit: The upper limit of detection of the measured points. This is needed if any of
   the data points have the value "U" (higher than detection limit).
       :param dimensions: The number of sample points at each time point. If this value is greater than
   one, then the dimensions will be interlaced - all the sample points for a
   point in time will be recorded at once.
       :param data: A series of data points which are decimal values separated by a single space
   (character u20). The special values "E" (error), "L" (below detection limit)
   and "U" (above detection limit) can also be used in place of a decimal value.
