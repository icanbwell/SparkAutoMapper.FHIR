       An address expressed using postal conventions (as opposed to GPS or other
   location definition formats).  This data type may be used to convey addresses
   for use in delivering mail as well as for visiting locations which might not
   be valid for mail delivery.  There are a variety of postal address formats
   defined around the world.

   defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param use: The purpose of this address.
       :param type_: Distinguishes between physical addresses (those you can visit) and mailing
   addresses (e.g. PO Boxes and care-of addresses). Most addresses are both.

   This may be provided instead of or as well as the specific parts.

   street direction,  P.O. Box number, delivery hints, and similar address
   information.
       :param city: The name of the city, town, suburb, village or other community or delivery
   center.
       :param district: The name of the administrative area (county).
       :param state: Sub-unit of a country with limited sovereignty in a federally organized
   country. A code may be used if codes are in common use (e.g. US 2 letter state
   codes).
       :param postalCode: A postal code designating a region defined by the postal service.
       :param country: Country - a nation as commonly understood or generally accepted.
