   NutritionOrder.OralDiet
       A request to supply a diet, formula feeding (enteral) or oral nutritional supplement to a patient/resident.

       A request to supply a diet, formula feeding (enteral) or oral nutritional
   supplement to a patient/resident.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param type_: The kind of diet or dietary restriction such as fiber restricted diet or
   diabetic diet.
       :param schedule: The time period and frequency at which the diet should be given.  The diet
   should be given for the combination of all schedules if more than one schedule
   is present.
       :param nutrient: Class that defines the quantity and type of nutrient modifications (for
   example carbohydrate, fiber or sodium) required for the oral diet.
       :param texture: Class that describes any texture modifications required for the patient to
   safely consume various types of solid foods.
       :param fluidConsistencyType: The required consistency (e.g. honey-thick, nectar-thick, thin, thickened.) of
   liquids or fluids served to the patient.
       :param instruction: Free text or additional instructions or information pertaining to the oral
   diet.
