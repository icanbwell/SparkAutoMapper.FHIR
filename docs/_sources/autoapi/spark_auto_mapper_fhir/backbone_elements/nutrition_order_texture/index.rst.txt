   NutritionOrder.Texture
       A request to supply a diet, formula feeding (enteral) or oral nutritional supplement to a patient/resident.

       A request to supply a diet, formula feeding (enteral) or oral nutritional
   supplement to a patient/resident.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param modifier: Any texture modifications (for solid foods) that should be made, e.g. easy to
   chew, chopped, ground, and pureed.
       :param foodType: The food type(s) (e.g. meats, all foods)  that the texture modification
   applies to.  This could be all foods types.
