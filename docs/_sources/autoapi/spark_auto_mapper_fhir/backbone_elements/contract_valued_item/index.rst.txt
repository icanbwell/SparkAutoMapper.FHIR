       Legally enforceable, formally recorded unilateral or bilateral directive i.e., a policy or agreement.

       Legally enforceable, formally recorded unilateral or bilateral directive i.e.,
   a policy or agreement.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param entityCodeableConcept: None
       :param entityReference: None
       :param identifier: Identifies a Contract Valued Item instance.
       :param effectiveTime: Indicates the time during which this Contract ValuedItem information is
   effective.
       :param quantity: Specifies the units by which the Contract Valued Item is measured or counted,
   and quantifies the countable or measurable Contract Valued Item instances.
       :param unitPrice: A Contract Valued Item unit valuation measure.
       :param factor: A real number that represents a multiplier used in determining the overall
   value of the Contract Valued Item delivered. The concept of a Factor allows
   for a discount or surcharge multiplier to be applied to a monetary amount.
       :param points: An amount that expresses the weighting (based on difficulty, cost and/or
   resource intensiveness) associated with the Contract Valued Item delivered.
   The concept of Points allows for assignment of point values for a Contract
   Valued Item, such that a monetary amount can be assigned to each point.
       :param net: Expresses the product of the Contract Valued Item unitQuantity and the
   unitPriceAmt. For example, the formula: unit Quantity * unit Price (Cost per
   Point) * factor Number  * points = net Amount. Quantity, factor and points are
   assumed to be 1 if not supplied.
       :param payment: Terms of valuation.
       :param paymentDate: When payment is due.
       :param responsible: Who will make payment.
       :param recipient: Who will receive payment.
       :param linkId: Id  of the clause or question text related to the context of this valuedItem
   in the referenced form or QuestionnaireResponse.
       :param securityLabelNumber: A set of security labels that define which terms are controlled by this
   condition.
