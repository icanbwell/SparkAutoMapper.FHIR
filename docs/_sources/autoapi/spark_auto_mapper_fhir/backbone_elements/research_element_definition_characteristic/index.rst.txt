   ResearchElementDefinition.Characteristic
       The ResearchElementDefinition resource describes a "PICO" element that knowledge (evidence, assertion, recommendation) is about.

       The ResearchElementDefinition resource describes a "PICO" element that
   knowledge (evidence, assertion, recommendation) is about.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param definitionCodeableConcept: None
       :param definitionCanonical: None
       :param definitionExpression: None
       :param definitionDataRequirement: None
       :param usageContext: Use UsageContext to define the members of the population, such as Age Ranges,
   Genders, Settings.
       :param exclude: When true, members with this characteristic are excluded from the element.
       :param unitOfMeasure: Specifies the UCUM unit for the outcome.
       :param studyEffectiveDescription: A narrative description of the time period the study covers.
       :param studyEffectiveDateTime: None
       :param studyEffectivePeriod: None
       :param studyEffectiveDuration: None
       :param studyEffectiveTiming: None
       :param studyEffectiveTimeFromStart: Indicates duration from the study initiation.
       :param studyEffectiveGroupMeasure: Indicates how elements are aggregated within the study effective period.
       :param participantEffectiveDescription: A narrative description of the time period the study covers.
       :param participantEffectiveDateTime: None
       :param participantEffectivePeriod: None
       :param participantEffectiveDuration: None
       :param participantEffectiveTiming: None
       :param participantEffectiveTimeFromStart: Indicates duration from the participant's study entry.
       :param participantEffectiveGroupMeasure: Indicates how elements are aggregated within the study effective period.
