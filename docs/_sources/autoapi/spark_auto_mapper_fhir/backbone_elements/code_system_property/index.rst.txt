   CodeSystem.Property
       The CodeSystem resource is used to declare the existence of and describe a code system or code system supplement and its key properties, and optionally define a part or all of its content.

       The CodeSystem resource is used to declare the existence of and describe a
   code system or code system supplement and its key properties, and optionally
   define a part or all of its content.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param code: A code that is used to identify the property. The code is used internally (in
   CodeSystem.concept.property.code) and also externally, such as in property
   filters.
       :param uri: Reference to the formal meaning of the property. One possible source of
   meaning is the [Concept Properties](codesystem-concept-properties.html) code
   system.
       :param description: A description of the property- why it is defined, and how its value might be
   used.
       :param type_: The type of the property value. Properties of type "code" contain a code
   defined by the code system (e.g. a reference to another defined concept).
