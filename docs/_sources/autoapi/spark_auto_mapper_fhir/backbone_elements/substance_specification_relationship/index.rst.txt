   SubstanceSpecification.Relationship
       The detailed description of a substance, typically at a level beyond what is used for prescribing.

       The detailed description of a substance, typically at a level beyond what is
   used for prescribing.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param substanceReference: None
       :param substanceCodeableConcept: None
       :param relationship: For example "salt to parent", "active moiety", "starting material".
       :param isDefining: For example where an enzyme strongly bonds with a particular substance, this
   is a defining relationship for that enzyme, out of several possible substance
   relationships.
       :param amountQuantity: None
       :param amountRange: None
       :param amountRatio: None
       :param amountString: None
       :param amountRatioLowLimit: For use when the numeric.
       :param amountType: An operator for the amount, for example "average", "approximately", "less
   than".
       :param source: Supporting literature.
