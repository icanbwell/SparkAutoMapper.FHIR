   GraphDefinition.Link
       A formal computable definition of a graph of resources - that is, a coherent set of resources that form a graph by following references. The Graph Definition resource defines a set and makes rules about the set.

       A formal computable definition of a graph of resources - that is, a coherent
   set of resources that form a graph by following references. The Graph
   Definition resource defines a set and makes rules about the set.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param path: A FHIR expression that identifies one of FHIR References to other resources.
       :param sliceName: Which slice (if profiled).
       :param min: Minimum occurrences for this link.
       :param max: Maximum occurrences for this link.
       :param description: Information about why this link is of interest in this graph definition.
       :param target: Potential target for the link.
