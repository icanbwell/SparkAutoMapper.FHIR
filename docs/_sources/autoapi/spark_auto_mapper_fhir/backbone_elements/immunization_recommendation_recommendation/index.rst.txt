   ImmunizationRecommendation.Recommendation
       A patient's point-in-time set of recommendations (i.e. forecasting) according to a published schedule with optional supporting justification.

       A patient's point-in-time set of recommendations (i.e. forecasting) according
   to a published schedule with optional supporting justification.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param vaccineCode: Vaccine(s) or vaccine group that pertain to the recommendation.
       :param targetDisease: The targeted disease for the recommendation.
       :param contraindicatedVaccineCode: Vaccine(s) which should not be used to fulfill the recommendation.
       :param forecastStatus: Indicates the patient status with respect to the path to immunity for the
   target disease.
       :param forecastReason: The reason for the assigned forecast status.
       :param dateCriterion: Vaccine date recommendations.  For example, earliest date to administer,
   latest date to administer, etc.
       :param description: Contains the description about the protocol under which the vaccine was
   administered.
       :param series: One possible path to achieve presumed immunity against a disease - within the
   context of an authority.
       :param doseNumberPositiveInt: None
       :param doseNumberString: None
       :param seriesDosesPositiveInt: None
       :param seriesDosesString: None
       :param supportingImmunization: Immunization event history and/or evaluation that supports the status and
   recommendation.
       :param supportingPatientInformation: Patient Information that supports the status and recommendation.  This
   includes patient observations, adverse reactions and allergy/intolerance
   information.
