       Measurements and simple assertions made about a patient, device or other subject.

   subject.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param low: The value of the low bound of the reference range.  The low bound of the
   reference range endpoint is inclusive of the value (e.g.  reference range is
   >=5 - <=9). If the low bound is omitted,  it is assumed to be meaningless
   (e.g. reference range is <=2.3).
       :param high: The value of the high bound of the reference range.  The high bound of the
   reference range endpoint is inclusive of the value (e.g.  reference range is
   >=5 - <=9). If the high bound is omitted,  it is assumed to be meaningless
   (e.g. reference range is >= 2.3).
       :param type_: Codes to indicate the what part of the targeted reference population it
   applies to. For example, the normal or therapeutic range.
       :param appliesTo: Codes to indicate the target population this reference range applies to.  For
   example, a reference range may be based on the normal population or a
   particular sex or race.  Multiple `appliesTo`  are interpreted as an "AND" of
   the target populations.  For example, to represent a target population of
   African American females, both a code of female and a code for African
   American would be used.
       :param age: The age at which this reference range is applicable. This is a neonatal age
   (e.g. number of weeks at term) if the meaning says so.
       :param text: Text based reference range in an observation which may be used when a
   quantitative range is not appropriate for an observation.  An example would be
   a reference value of "Negative" or a list or table of "normals".
