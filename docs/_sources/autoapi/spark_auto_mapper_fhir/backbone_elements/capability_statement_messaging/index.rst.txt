   CapabilityStatement.Messaging
       A Capability Statement documents a set of capabilities (behaviors) of a FHIR Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server implementation.

   implementation.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param endpoint: An endpoint (network accessible address) to which messages and/or replies are
   to be sent.
       :param reliableCache: Length if the receiver's reliable messaging cache in minutes (if a receiver)
   or how long the cache length on the receiver should be (if a sender).
       :param documentation: Documentation about the system's messaging capabilities for this endpoint not
   otherwise documented by the capability statement.  For example, the process
   for becoming an authorized messaging exchange partner.
       :param supportedMessage: References to message definitions for messages this system can send or
   receive.
