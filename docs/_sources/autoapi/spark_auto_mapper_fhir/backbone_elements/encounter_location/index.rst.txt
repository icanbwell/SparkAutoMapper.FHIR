   Encounter.Location
       An interaction between a patient and healthcare provider(s) for the purpose of providing healthcare service(s) or assessing the health status of a patient.

       An interaction between a patient and healthcare provider(s) for the purpose of
   providing healthcare service(s) or assessing the health status of a patient.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param location: The location where the encounter takes place.
       :param status: The status of the participants' presence at the specified location during the
   period specified. If the participant is no longer at the location, then the
   period will have an end date/time.
       :param physicalType: This will be used to specify the required levels (bed/ward/room/etc.) desired
   to be recorded to simplify either messaging or query.
       :param period: Time period during which the patient was present at the location.
