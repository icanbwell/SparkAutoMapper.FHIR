   OperationOutcome.Issue
       A collection of error, warning, or information messages that result from a system action.

       A collection of error, warning, or information messages that result from a
   system action.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param severity: Indicates whether the issue indicates a variation from successful processing.
       :param code: Describes the type of the issue. The system that creates an OperationOutcome
   SHALL choose the most applicable code from the IssueType value set, and may
   additional provide its own code for the error in the details element.
       :param details: Additional details about the error. This may be a text description of the
   error or a system code that identifies the error.
       :param diagnostics: Additional diagnostic information about the issue.
       :param location: This element is deprecated because it is XML specific. It is replaced by
   issue.expression, which is format independent, and simpler to parse.

   For resource issues, this will be a simple XPath limited to element names,
   repetition indicators and the default child accessor that identifies one of
   the elements in the resource that caused this issue to be raised.  For HTTP
   errors, will be "http." + the parameter name.
       :param expression: A [simple subset of FHIRPath](fhirpath.html#simple) limited to element names,
   repetition indicators and the default child accessor that identifies one of
   the elements in the resource that caused this issue to be raised.
