   MedicationAdministration.Dosage
       Describes the event of a patient consuming or otherwise being administered a medication.  This may be as simple as swallowing a tablet or it may be a long running infusion.  Related resources tie this event to the authorizing prescription, and the specific encounter between patient and health care practitioner.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param text: Free text dosage can be used for cases where the dosage administered is too
   complex to code. When coded dosage is present, the free text dosage may still
   be present for display to humans.

   The dosage instructions should reflect the dosage of the medication that was
   administered.
       :param site: A coded specification of the anatomic site where the medication first entered
   the body.  For example, "left arm".
       :param route: A code specifying the route or physiological path of administration of a
   therapeutic agent into or onto the patient.  For example, topical,
   intravenous, etc.
       :param method: A coded value indicating the method by which the medication is intended to be
   or was introduced into or on the body.  This attribute will most often NOT be
   populated.  It is most commonly used for injections.  For example, Slow Push,
   Deep IV.
       :param dose: The amount of the medication given at one administration event.   Use this
   value when the administration is essentially an instantaneous event such as a
   swallowing a tablet or giving an injection.
       :param rateRatio: None
       :param rateQuantity: None
