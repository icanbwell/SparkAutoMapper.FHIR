   Measure.Stratifier
       The Measure resource provides the definition of a quality measure.

       The Measure resource provides the definition of a quality measure.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param code: Indicates a meaning for the stratifier. This can be as simple as a unique
   identifier, or it can establish meaning in a broader context by drawing from a
   terminology, allowing stratifiers to be correlated across measures.
       :param description: The human readable description of this stratifier criteria.
       :param criteria: An expression that specifies the criteria for the stratifier. This is
   typically the name of an expression defined within a referenced library, but
   it may also be a path to a stratifier element.
       :param component: A component of the stratifier criteria for the measure report, specified as
   either the name of a valid CQL expression defined within a referenced library
   or a valid FHIR Resource Path.
