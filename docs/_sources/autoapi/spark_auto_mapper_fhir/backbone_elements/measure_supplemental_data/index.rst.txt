   Measure.SupplementalData
       The Measure resource provides the definition of a quality measure.

       The Measure resource provides the definition of a quality measure.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param code: Indicates a meaning for the supplemental data. This can be as simple as a
   unique identifier, or it can establish meaning in a broader context by drawing
   from a terminology, allowing supplemental data to be correlated across
   measures.
       :param usage: An indicator of the intended usage for the supplemental data element.
   Supplemental data indicates the data is additional information requested to
   augment the measure information. Risk adjustment factor indicates the data is
   additional information used to calculate risk adjustment factors when applying
   a risk model to the measure calculation.
       :param description: The human readable description of this supplemental data.
       :param criteria: The criteria for the supplemental data. This is typically the name of a valid
   expression defined within a referenced library, but it may also be a path to a
   specific data element. The criteria defines the data to be returned for this
   element.
