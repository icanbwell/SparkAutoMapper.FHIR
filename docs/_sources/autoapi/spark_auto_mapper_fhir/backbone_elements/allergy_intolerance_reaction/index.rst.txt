   AllergyIntolerance.Reaction
       Risk of harmful or undesirable, physiological response which is unique to an individual and associated with exposure to a substance.

       Risk of harmful or undesirable, physiological response which is unique to an
   individual and associated with exposure to a substance.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param substance: Identification of the specific substance (or pharmaceutical product)
   considered to be responsible for the Adverse Reaction event. Note: the
   substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance
   identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For
   instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a
   composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be
   clinically safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the
   'reaction.substance'.  If a receiving system is unable to confirm that
   AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within the semantic scope of
   AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system should ignore
   AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.
       :param manifestation: Clinical symptoms and/or signs that are observed or associated with the
   adverse reaction event.
       :param description: Text description about the reaction as a whole, including details of the
   manifestation if required.
       :param onset: Record of the date and/or time of the onset of the Reaction.
       :param severity: Clinical assessment of the severity of the reaction event as a whole,
   potentially considering multiple different manifestations.
       :param exposureRoute: Identification of the route by which the subject was exposed to the substance.
       :param note: Additional text about the adverse reaction event not captured in other fields.
