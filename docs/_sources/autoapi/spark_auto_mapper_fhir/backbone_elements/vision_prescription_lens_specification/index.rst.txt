   VisionPrescription.LensSpecification
       An authorization for the provision of glasses and/or contact lenses to a patient.

       An authorization for the provision of glasses and/or contact lenses to a
   patient.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param product: Identifies the type of vision correction product which is required for the
   patient.
       :param eye: The eye for which the lens specification applies.
       :param sphere: Lens power measured in dioptres (0.25 units).
       :param cylinder: Power adjustment for astigmatism measured in dioptres (0.25 units).
       :param axis: Adjustment for astigmatism measured in integer degrees.
       :param prism: Allows for adjustment on two axis.
       :param add: Power adjustment for multifocal lenses measured in dioptres (0.25 units).
       :param power: Contact lens power measured in dioptres (0.25 units).
       :param backCurve: Back curvature measured in millimetres.
       :param diameter: Contact lens diameter measured in millimetres.
       :param duration: The recommended maximum wear period for the lens.
       :param color: Special color or pattern.
       :param brand: Brand recommendations or restrictions.
       :param note: Notes for special requirements such as coatings and lens materials.
