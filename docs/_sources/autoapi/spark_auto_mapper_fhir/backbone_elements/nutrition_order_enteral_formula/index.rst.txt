   NutritionOrder.EnteralFormula
       A request to supply a diet, formula feeding (enteral) or oral nutritional supplement to a patient/resident.

       A request to supply a diet, formula feeding (enteral) or oral nutritional
   supplement to a patient/resident.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param baseFormulaType: The type of enteral or infant formula such as an adult standard formula with
   fiber or a soy-based infant formula.
       :param baseFormulaProductName: The product or brand name of the enteral or infant formula product such as
   "ACME Adult Standard Formula".
       :param additiveType: Indicates the type of modular component such as protein, carbohydrate, fat or
   fiber to be provided in addition to or mixed with the base formula.
       :param additiveProductName: The product or brand name of the type of modular component to be added to the
   formula.
       :param caloricDensity: The amount of energy (calories) that the formula should provide per specified
   volume, typically per mL or fluid oz.  For example, an infant may require a
   formula that provides 24 calories per fluid ounce or an adult may require an
   enteral formula that provides 1.5 calorie/mL.
       :param routeofAdministration: The route or physiological path of administration into the patient's
   gastrointestinal  tract for purposes of providing the formula feeding, e.g.
   nasogastric tube.
       :param administration: Formula administration instructions as structured data.  This repeating
   structure allows for changing the administration rate or volume over time for
   both bolus and continuous feeding.  An example of this would be an instruction
   to increase the rate of continuous feeding every 2 hours.
       :param maxVolumeToDeliver: The maximum total quantity of formula that may be administered to a subject
   over the period of time, e.g. 1440 mL over 24 hours.
       :param administrationInstruction: Free text formula administration, feeding instructions or additional
   instructions or information.
