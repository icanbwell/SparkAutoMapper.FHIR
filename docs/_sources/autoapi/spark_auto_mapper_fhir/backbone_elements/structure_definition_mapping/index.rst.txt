   StructureDefinition.Mapping
       A definition of a FHIR structure. This resource is used to describe the underlying resources, data types defined in FHIR, and also for describing extensions and constraints on resources and data types.

       A definition of a FHIR structure. This resource is used to describe the
   underlying resources, data types defined in FHIR, and also for describing
   extensions and constraints on resources and data types.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identity: An Internal id that is used to identify this mapping set when specific
   mappings are made.
       :param uri: An absolute URI that identifies the specification that this mapping is
   expressed to.
       :param name: A name for the specification that is being mapped to.
       :param comment: Comments about this mapping, including version notes, issues, scope
   limitations, and other important notes for usage.
