   ValueSet.Filter
       A ValueSet resource instance specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more code systems, intended for use in a particular context. Value sets link between [[[CodeSystem]]] definitions and their use in [coded elements](terminologies.html).

   elements](terminologies.html).

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param property: A code that identifies a property or a filter defined in the code system.
       :param op: The kind of operation to perform as a part of the filter criteria.
       :param value: The match value may be either a code defined by the system, or a string value,
   which is a regex match on the literal string of the property value  (if the
   filter represents a property defined in CodeSystem) or of the system filter
   value (if the filter represents a filter defined in CodeSystem) when the
   operation is 'regex', or one of the values (true and false), when the
   operation is 'exists'.
