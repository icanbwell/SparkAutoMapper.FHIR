   SubstanceSourceMaterial.Organism
       Source material shall capture information on the taxonomic and anatomical origins as well as the fraction of a material that can result in or can be modified to form a substance. This set of data elements shall be used to define polymer substances isolated from biological matrices. Taxonomic and anatomical origins shall be described using a controlled vocabulary as required. This information is captured for naturally derived polymers ( . starch) and structurally diverse substances. For Organisms belonging to the Kingdom Plantae the Substance level defines the fresh material of a single species or infraspecies, the Herbal Drug and the Herbal preparation. For Herbal preparations, the fraction information will be captured at the Substance information level and additional information for herbal extracts will be captured at the Specified Substance Group 1 information level. See for further explanation the Substance Class: Structurally Diverse and the herbal annex.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param family: The family of an organism shall be specified.
       :param genus: The genus of an organism shall be specified; refers to the Latin epithet of
   the genus element of the plant/animal scientific name; it is present in names
   for genera, species and infraspecies.
       :param species: The species of an organism shall be specified; refers to the Latin epithet of
   the species of the plant/animal; it is present in names for species and
   infraspecies.
       :param intraspecificType: The Intraspecific type of an organism shall be specified.
       :param intraspecificDescription: The intraspecific description of an organism shall be specified based on a
   controlled vocabulary. For Influenza Vaccine, the intraspecific description
   shall contain the syntax of the antigen in line with the WHO convention.
       :param author: 4.9.13.6.1 Author type (Conditional).
       :param hybrid: 4.9.13.8.1 Hybrid species maternal organism ID (Optional).
       :param organismGeneral: 4.9.13.7.1 Kingdom (Conditional).
