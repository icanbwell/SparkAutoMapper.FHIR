   ValueSet.Contains
       A ValueSet resource instance specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more code systems, intended for use in a particular context. Value sets link between [[[CodeSystem]]] definitions and their use in [coded elements](terminologies.html).

       A ValueSet resource instance specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more
   code systems, intended for use in a particular context. Value sets link
   between [[[CodeSystem]]] definitions and their use in [coded
   elements](terminologies.html).

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param system: An absolute URI which is the code system in which the code for this item in
   the expansion is defined.
       :param abstract: If true, this entry is included in the expansion for navigational purposes,
   and the user cannot select the code directly as a proper value.
       :param inactive: If the concept is inactive in the code system that defines it. Inactive codes
   are those that are no longer to be used, but are maintained by the code system
   for understanding legacy data. It might not be known or specified whether an
   concept is inactive (and it may depend on the context of use).
       :param version: The version of the code system from this code was taken. Note that a well-
   maintained code system does not need the version reported, because the meaning
   of codes is consistent across versions. However this cannot consistently be
   assured, and when the meaning is not guaranteed to be consistent, the version
   SHOULD be exchanged.
       :param code: The code for this item in the expansion hierarchy. If this code is missing the
   entry in the hierarchy is a place holder (abstract) and does not represent a
   valid code in the value set.
       :param display: The recommended display for this item in the expansion.
       :param designation: Additional representations for this item - other languages, aliases,
   specialized purposes, used for particular purposes, etc. These are relevant
   when the conditions of the expansion do not fix to a single correct
   representation.
       :param contains: Other codes and entries contained under this entry in the hierarchy.
