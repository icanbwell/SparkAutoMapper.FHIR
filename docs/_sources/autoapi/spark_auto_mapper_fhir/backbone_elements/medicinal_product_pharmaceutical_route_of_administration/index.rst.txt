   MedicinalProductPharmaceutical.RouteOfAdministration
       A pharmaceutical product described in terms of its composition and dose form.

       A pharmaceutical product described in terms of its composition and dose form.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param code: Coded expression for the route.
       :param firstDose: The first dose (dose quantity) administered in humans can be specified, for a
   product under investigation, using a numerical value and its unit of
   measurement.
       :param maxSingleDose: The maximum single dose that can be administered as per the protocol of a
   clinical trial can be specified using a numerical value and its unit of
   measurement.
       :param maxDosePerDay: The maximum dose per day (maximum dose quantity to be administered in any one
   24-h period) that can be administered as per the protocol referenced in the
   clinical trial authorisation.
       :param maxDosePerTreatmentPeriod: The maximum dose per treatment period that can be administered as per the
   protocol referenced in the clinical trial authorisation.
       :param maxTreatmentPeriod: The maximum treatment period during which an Investigational Medicinal Product
   can be administered as per the protocol referenced in the clinical trial
   authorisation.
       :param targetSpecies: A species for which this route applies.
