   MolecularSequence.Repository
       Raw data describing a biological sequence.

       Raw data describing a biological sequence.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param type_: Click and see / RESTful API / Need login to see / RESTful API with
   authentication / Other ways to see resource.
       :param url: URI of an external repository which contains further details about the
   genetics data.
       :param name: URI of an external repository which contains further details about the
   genetics data.
       :param datasetId: Id of the variant in this external repository. The server will understand how
   to use this id to call for more info about datasets in external repository.
       :param variantsetId: Id of the variantset in this external repository. The server will understand
   how to use this id to call for more info about variantsets in external
   repository.
       :param readsetId: Id of the read in this external repository.
