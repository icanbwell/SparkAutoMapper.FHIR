   ChargeItemDefinition.Applicability
       The ChargeItemDefinition resource provides the properties that apply to the (billing) codes necessary to calculate costs and prices. The properties may differ largely depending on type and realm, therefore this resource gives only a rough structure and requires profiling for each type of billing code system.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param description: A brief, natural language description of the condition that effectively
   communicates the intended semantics.
       :param language: The media type of the language for the expression, e.g. "text/cql" for
   Clinical Query Language expressions or "text/fhirpath" for FHIRPath
   expressions.
       :param expression: An expression that returns true or false, indicating whether the condition is
   satisfied. When using FHIRPath expressions, the %context environment variable
   must be replaced at runtime with the ChargeItem resource to which this
   definition is applied.
