       A clinical condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern.

       A clinical condition, problem, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or
   clinical concept that has risen to a level of concern.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param summary: A simple summary of the stage such as "Stage 3". The determination of the
   stage is disease-specific.
       :param assessment: Reference to a formal record of the evidence on which the staging assessment
   is based.
       :param type_: The kind of staging, such as pathological or clinical staging.
