   ClaimResponse.Error
       This resource provides the adjudication details from the processing of a Claim resource.

       This resource provides the adjudication details from the processing of a Claim
   resource.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param itemSequence: The sequence number of the line item submitted which contains the error. This
   value is omitted when the error occurs outside of the item structure.
       :param detailSequence: The sequence number of the detail within the line item submitted which
   contains the error. This value is omitted when the error occurs outside of the
   item structure.
       :param subDetailSequence: The sequence number of the sub-detail within the detail within the line item
   submitted which contains the error. This value is omitted when the error
   occurs outside of the item structure.
       :param code: An error code, from a specified code system, which details why the claim could
   not be adjudicated.
