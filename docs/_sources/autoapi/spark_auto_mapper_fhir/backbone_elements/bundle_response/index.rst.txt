       A container for a collection of resources.

       A container for a collection of resources.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param status: The status code returned by processing this entry. The status SHALL start with
   a 3 digit HTTP code (e.g. 404) and may contain the standard HTTP description
   associated with the status code.
       :param location: The location header created by processing this operation, populated if the
   operation returns a location.
       :param etag: The Etag for the resource, if the operation for the entry produced a versioned
   resource (see [Resource Metadata and Versioning](http.html#versioning) and
   [Managing Resource Contention](http.html#concurrency)).
       :param lastModified: The date/time that the resource was modified on the server.
       :param outcome: An OperationOutcome containing hints and warnings produced as part of
   processing this entry in a batch or transaction.
