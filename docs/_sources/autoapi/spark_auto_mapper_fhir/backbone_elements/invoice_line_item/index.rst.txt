   Invoice.LineItem
       Invoice containing collected ChargeItems from an Account with calculated individual and total price for Billing purpose.

       Invoice containing collected ChargeItems from an Account with calculated
   individual and total price for Billing purpose.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param sequence: Sequence in which the items appear on the invoice.
       :param chargeItemReference: None
       :param chargeItemCodeableConcept: None
       :param priceComponent: The price for a ChargeItem may be calculated as a base price with
   surcharges/deductions that apply in certain conditions. A ChargeItemDefinition
   resource that defines the prices, factors and conditions that apply to a
   billing code is currently under development. The priceComponent element can be
   used to offer transparency to the recipient of the Invoice as to how the
   prices have been calculated.
