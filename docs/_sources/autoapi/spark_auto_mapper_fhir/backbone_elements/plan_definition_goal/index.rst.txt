   PlanDefinition.Goal
       This resource allows for the definition of various types of plans as a sharable, consumable, and executable artifact. The resource is general enough to support the description of a broad range of clinical artifacts such as clinical decision support rules, order sets and protocols.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param category: Indicates a category the goal falls within.
       :param description: Human-readable and/or coded description of a specific desired objective of
   care, such as "control blood pressure" or "negotiate an obstacle course" or
   "dance with child at wedding".
       :param priority: Identifies the expected level of importance associated with
   reaching/sustaining the defined goal.
       :param start: The event after which the goal should begin being pursued.
       :param addresses: Identifies problems, conditions, issues, or concerns the goal is intended to
   address.
       :param documentation: Didactic or other informational resources associated with the goal that
   provide further supporting information about the goal. Information resources
   can include inline text commentary and links to web resources.
       :param target: Indicates what should be done and within what timeframe.
