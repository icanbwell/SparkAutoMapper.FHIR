   CapabilityStatement.SearchParam
       A Capability Statement documents a set of capabilities (behaviors) of a FHIR Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server implementation.

   Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of

   implementation.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param name: The name of the search parameter used in the interface.
       :param definition: An absolute URI that is a formal reference to where this parameter was first
   defined, so that a client can be confident of the meaning of the search
   parameter (a reference to [[[SearchParameter.url]]]). This element SHALL be
   populated if the search parameter refers to a SearchParameter defined by the
   FHIR core specification or externally defined IGs.
       :param type_: The type of value a search parameter refers to, and how the content is
   interpreted.
       :param documentation: This allows documentation of any distinct behaviors about how the search
   parameter is used.  For example, text matching algorithms.
