   OperationDefinition.ReferencedFrom
       A formal computable definition of an operation (on the RESTful interface) or a named query (using the search interaction).

       A formal computable definition of an operation (on the RESTful interface) or a
   named query (using the search interaction).

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param source: The name of the parameter or dot-separated path of parameter names pointing to
   the resource parameter that is expected to contain a reference to this
   resource.
       :param sourceId: The id of the element in the referencing resource that is expected to resolve
   to this resource.
