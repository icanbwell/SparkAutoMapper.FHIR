   ObservationDefinition.QualifiedInterval
       Set of definitional characteristics for a kind of observation or measurement produced or consumed by an orderable health care service.

       Set of definitional characteristics for a kind of observation or measurement
   produced or consumed by an orderable health care service.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param category: The category of interval of values for continuous or ordinal observations
   conforming to this ObservationDefinition.
       :param range: The low and high values determining the interval. There may be only one of the
   two.
       :param context: Codes to indicate the health context the range applies to. For example, the
   normal or therapeutic range.
       :param appliesTo: Codes to indicate the target population this reference range applies to.
       :param gender: Sex of the population the range applies to.
       :param age: The age at which this reference range is applicable. This is a neonatal age
   (e.g. number of weeks at term) if the meaning says so.
       :param gestationalAge: The gestational age to which this reference range is applicable, in the
   context of pregnancy.
       :param condition: Text based condition for which the reference range is valid.
