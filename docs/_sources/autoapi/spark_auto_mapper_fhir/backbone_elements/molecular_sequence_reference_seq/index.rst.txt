   MolecularSequence.ReferenceSeq
       Raw data describing a biological sequence.

       Raw data describing a biological sequence.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param chromosome: Structural unit composed of a nucleic acid molecule which controls its own
   replication through the interaction of specific proteins at one or more
   origins of replication ([SO:0000340](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/c
   urrent_svn/term/SO:0000340)).
       :param genomeBuild: The Genome Build used for reference, following GRCh build versions e.g. 'GRCh
   37'.  Version number must be included if a versioned release of a primary
   build was used.
       :param orientation: A relative reference to a DNA strand based on gene orientation. The strand
   that contains the open reading frame of the gene is the "sense" strand, and
   the opposite complementary strand is the "antisense" strand.
       :param referenceSeqId: Reference identifier of reference sequence submitted to NCBI. It must match
   the type in the MolecularSequence.type field. For example, the prefix, “NG_”
   identifies reference sequence for genes, “NM_” for messenger RNA transcripts,
   and “NP_” for amino acid sequences.
       :param referenceSeqPointer: A pointer to another MolecularSequence entity as reference sequence.
       :param referenceSeqString: A string like "ACGT".
       :param strand: An absolute reference to a strand. The Watson strand is the strand whose
   5'-end is on the short arm of the chromosome, and the Crick strand as the one
   whose 5'-end is on the long arm.
       :param windowStart: Start position of the window on the reference sequence. If the coordinate
   system is either 0-based or 1-based, then start position is inclusive.
       :param windowEnd: End position of the window on the reference sequence. If the coordinate system
   is 0-based then end is exclusive and does not include the last position. If
   the coordinate system is 1-base, then end is inclusive and includes the last
   position.
