       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param kind: A description of the kind of resource the in-line definition of a care plan
   activity is representing.  The CarePlan.activity.detail is an in-line
   definition when a resource is not referenced using
   CarePlan.activity.reference.  For example, a MedicationRequest, a
   ServiceRequest, or a CommunicationRequest.
       :param instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, questionnaire or other
   definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this CarePlan activity.
       :param instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline,
   questionnaire or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by
   this CarePlan activity.
       :param code: Detailed description of the type of planned activity; e.g. what lab test, what
   procedure, what kind of encounter.
       :param reasonCode: Provides the rationale that drove the inclusion of this particular activity as
   part of the plan or the reason why the activity was prohibited.
       :param reasonReference: Indicates another resource, such as the health condition(s), whose existence
   justifies this request and drove the inclusion of this particular activity as
   part of the plan.
       :param goal: Internal reference that identifies the goals that this activity is intended to
   contribute towards meeting.
       :param status: Identifies what progress is being made for the specific activity.
       :param statusReason: Provides reason why the activity isn't yet started, is on hold, was cancelled,
   etc.
       :param doNotPerform: If true, indicates that the described activity is one that must NOT be engaged
   in when following the plan.  If false, or missing, indicates that the
   described activity is one that should be engaged in when following the plan.
       :param scheduledTiming: None
       :param scheduledPeriod: None
       :param scheduledString: None
       :param location: Identifies the facility where the activity will occur; e.g. home, hospital,
   specific clinic, etc.
       :param performer: Identifies who's expected to be involved in the activity.
       :param productCodeableConcept: None
       :param productReference: None
       :param dailyAmount: Identifies the quantity expected to be consumed in a given day.
       :param quantity: Identifies the quantity expected to be supplied, administered or consumed by
   the subject.
       :param description: This provides a textual description of constraints on the intended activity
   occurrence, including relation to other activities.  It may also include
   objectives, pre-conditions and end-conditions.  Finally, it may convey
   specifics about the activity such as body site, method, route, etc.
