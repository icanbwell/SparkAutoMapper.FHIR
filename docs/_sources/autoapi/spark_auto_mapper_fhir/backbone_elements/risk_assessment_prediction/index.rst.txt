   RiskAssessment.Prediction
       An assessment of the likely outcome(s) for a patient or other subject as well as the likelihood of each outcome.

       An assessment of the likely outcome(s) for a patient or other subject as well
   as the likelihood of each outcome.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param outcome: One of the potential outcomes for the patient (e.g. remission, death,  a
   particular condition).
       :param probabilityDecimal: None
       :param probabilityRange: None
       :param qualitativeRisk: Indicates how likely the outcome is (in the specified timeframe), expressed as
   a qualitative value (e.g. low, medium, or high).
       :param relativeRisk: Indicates the risk for this particular subject (with their specific
   characteristics) divided by the risk of the population in general.  (Numbers
   greater than 1 = higher risk than the population, numbers less than 1 = lower
   risk.).
       :param whenPeriod: None
       :param whenRange: None
       :param rationale: Additional information explaining the basis for the prediction.
