   MedicationRequest.DispenseRequest
       An order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for administration of the medication to a patient. The resource is called "MedicationRequest" rather than "MedicationPrescription" or "MedicationOrder" to generalize the use across inpatient and outpatient settings, including care plans, etc., and to harmonize with workflow patterns.

       An order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for
   administration of the medication to a patient. The resource is called
   "MedicationRequest" rather than "MedicationPrescription" or "MedicationOrder"
   to generalize the use across inpatient and outpatient settings, including care
   plans, etc., and to harmonize with workflow patterns.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param initialFill: Indicates the quantity or duration for the first dispense of the medication.
       :param dispenseInterval: The minimum period of time that must occur between dispenses of the
   medication.
       :param validityPeriod: This indicates the validity period of a prescription (stale dating the
   Prescription).
       :param numberOfRepeatsAllowed: An integer indicating the number of times, in addition to the original
   dispense, (aka refills or repeats) that the patient can receive the prescribed
   medication. Usage Notes: This integer does not include the original order
   dispense. This means that if an order indicates dispense 30 tablets plus "3
   repeats", then the order can be dispensed a total of 4 times and the patient
   can receive a total of 120 tablets.  A prescriber may explicitly say that zero
   refills are permitted after the initial dispense.
       :param quantity: The amount that is to be dispensed for one fill.
       :param expectedSupplyDuration: Identifies the period time over which the supplied product is expected to be
   used, or the length of time the dispense is expected to last.
       :param performer: Indicates the intended dispensing Organization specified by the prescriber.
