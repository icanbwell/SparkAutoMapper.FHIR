   CapabilityStatement.Rest
       A Capability Statement documents a set of capabilities (behaviors) of a FHIR Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server implementation.

   Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of
   actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server
   implementation.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param mode: Identifies whether this portion of the statement is describing the ability to
   initiate or receive restful operations.
       :param documentation: Information about the system's restful capabilities that apply across all
   applications, such as security.
       :param security: Information about security implementation from an interface perspective - what
   a client needs to know.
       :param resource: A specification of the restful capabilities of the solution for a specific
   resource type.
       :param interaction: A specification of restful operations supported by the system.
       :param searchParam: Search parameters that are supported for searching all resources for
   implementations to support and/or make use of - either references to ones
   defined in the specification, or additional ones defined for/by the
   implementation.
       :param operation: Definition of an operation or a named query together with its parameters and
   their meaning and type.
       :param compartment: An absolute URI which is a reference to the definition of a compartment that
   the system supports. The reference is to a CompartmentDefinition resource by
   its canonical URL .
