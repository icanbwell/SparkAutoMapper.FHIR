       A container for a collection of resources.

       A container for a collection of resources.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param method: In a transaction or batch, this is the HTTP action to be executed for this
   entry. In a history bundle, this indicates the HTTP action that occurred.
       :param url: The URL for this entry, relative to the root (the address to which the request
   is posted).
       :param ifNoneMatch: If the ETag values match, return a 304 Not Modified status. See the API
   documentation for ["Conditional Read"](http.html#cread).
       :param ifModifiedSince: Only perform the operation if the last updated date matches. See the API
   documentation for ["Conditional Read"](http.html#cread).
       :param ifMatch: Only perform the operation if the Etag value matches. For more information,
   see the API section ["Managing Resource Contention"](http.html#concurrency).
       :param ifNoneExist: Instruct the server not to perform the create if a specified resource already
   exists. For further information, see the API documentation for ["Conditional
   Create"](http.html#ccreate). This is just the query portion of the URL - what
   follows the "?" (not including the "?").
