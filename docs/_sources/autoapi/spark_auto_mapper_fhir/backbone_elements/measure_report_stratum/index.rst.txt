   MeasureReport.Stratum
       The MeasureReport resource contains the results of the calculation of a measure; and optionally a reference to the resources involved in that calculation.

       The MeasureReport resource contains the results of the calculation of a
   measure; and optionally a reference to the resources involved in that
   calculation.

       :param id_: None
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
   in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
   be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
   resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param value: The value for this stratum, expressed as a CodeableConcept. When defining
   stratifiers on complex values, the value must be rendered such that the value
   for each stratum within the stratifier is unique.
       :param component: A stratifier component value.
       :param population: The populations that make up the stratum, one for each type of population
   appropriate to the measure.
       :param measureScore: The measure score for this stratum, calculated as appropriate for the measure
   type and scoring method, and based on only the members of this stratum.
