   MedicationRequest
   medicationrequest.xsd
       An order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for
   administration of the medication to a patient. The resource is called
   "MedicationRequest" rather than "MedicationPrescription" or "MedicationOrder"
   to generalize the use across inpatient and outpatient settings, including care
   plans, etc., and to harmonize with workflow patterns.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       An order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for
   administration of the medication to a patient. The resource is called
   "MedicationRequest" rather than "MedicationPrescription" or "MedicationOrder"
   to generalize the use across inpatient and outpatient settings, including care
   plans, etc., and to harmonize with workflow patterns.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Identifiers associated with this medication request that are defined by
   business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to
   the resource itself is not appropriate. They are business identifiers assigned
   to this resource by the performer or other systems and remain constant as the
   resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
       :param status: A code specifying the current state of the order.  Generally, this will be
   active or completed state.
       :param statusReason: Captures the reason for the current state of the MedicationRequest.
       :param intent: Whether the request is a proposal, plan, or an original order.
       :param category: Indicates the type of medication request (for example, where the medication is
   expected to be consumed or administered (i.e. inpatient or outpatient)).
       :param priority: Indicates how quickly the Medication Request should be addressed with respect
   to other requests.
       :param doNotPerform: If true indicates that the provider is asking for the medication request not
   to occur.
       :param reportedBoolean: None
       :param reportedReference: None
       :param medicationCodeableConcept: None
       :param medicationReference: None
       :param subject: A link to a resource representing the person or set of individuals to whom the
   medication will be given.
       :param encounter: The Encounter during which this [x] was created or to which the creation of
   this record is tightly associated.
       :param supportingInformation: Include additional information (for example, patient height and weight) that
   supports the ordering of the medication.
       :param authoredOn: The date (and perhaps time) when the prescription was initially written or
   authored on.
       :param requester: The individual, organization, or device that initiated the request and has
   responsibility for its activation.
       :param performer: The specified desired performer of the medication treatment (e.g. the
   performer of the medication administration).
       :param performerType: Indicates the type of performer of the administration of the medication.
       :param recorder: The person who entered the order on behalf of another individual for example
   in the case of a verbal or a telephone order.
       :param reasonCode: The reason or the indication for ordering or not ordering the medication.
       :param reasonReference: Condition or observation that supports why the medication was ordered.
       :param instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a protocol, guideline, orderset, or other definition that
   is adhered to in whole or in part by this MedicationRequest.
       :param instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, orderset or
   other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this
   MedicationRequest.
       :param basedOn: A plan or request that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this medication
   request.
       :param groupIdentifier: A shared identifier common to all requests that were authorized more or less
   simultaneously by a single author, representing the identifier of the
   requisition or prescription.
       :param courseOfTherapyType: The description of the overall patte3rn of the administration of the
   medication to the patient.
       :param insurance: Insurance plans, coverage extensions, pre-authorizations and/or pre-
   determinations that may be required for delivering the requested service.
       :param note: Extra information about the prescription that could not be conveyed by the
   other attributes.
       :param dosageInstruction: Indicates how the medication is to be used by the patient.
       :param dispenseRequest: Indicates the specific details for the dispense or medication supply part of a
   medication request (also known as a Medication Prescription or Medication
   Order).  Note that this information is not always sent with the order.  There
   may be in some settings (e.g. hospitals) institutional or system support for
   completing the dispense details in the pharmacy department.
       :param substitution: Indicates whether or not substitution can or should be part of the dispense.
   In some cases, substitution must happen, in other cases substitution must not
   happen. This block explains the prescriber's intent. If nothing is specified
   substitution may be done.
       :param priorPrescription: A link to a resource representing an earlier order related order or
   prescription.
       :param detectedIssue: Indicates an actual or potential clinical issue with or between one or more
   active or proposed clinical actions for a patient; e.g. Drug-drug interaction,
   duplicate therapy, dosage alert etc.
       :param eventHistory: Links to Provenance records for past versions of this resource or fulfilling
   request or event resources that identify key state transitions or updates that
   are likely to be relevant to a user looking at the current version of the
   resource.
