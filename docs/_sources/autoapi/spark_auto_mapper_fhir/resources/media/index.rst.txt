   Media
   media.xsd
       A photo, video, or audio recording acquired or used in healthcare. The actual
   content may be inline or provided by direct reference.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       A photo, video, or audio recording acquired or used in healthcare. The actual
   content may be inline or provided by direct reference.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Identifiers associated with the image - these may include identifiers for the
   image itself, identifiers for the context of its collection (e.g. series ids)
   and context ids such as accession numbers or other workflow identifiers.
       :param basedOn: A procedure that is fulfilled in whole or in part by the creation of this
   media.
       :param partOf: A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step.
       :param status: The current state of the {{title}}.
       :param type_: A code that classifies whether the media is an image, video or audio recording
   or some other media category.
       :param modality: Details of the type of the media - usually, how it was acquired (what type of
   device). If images sourced from a DICOM system, are wrapped in a Media
   resource, then this is the modality.
       :param view: The name of the imaging view e.g. Lateral or Antero-posterior (AP).
       :param subject: Who/What this Media is a record of.
       :param encounter: The encounter that establishes the context for this media.
       :param createdDateTime: None
       :param createdPeriod: None
       :param issued: The date and time this version of the media was made available to providers,
   typically after having been reviewed.
       :param operator: The person who administered the collection of the image.
       :param reasonCode: Describes why the event occurred in coded or textual form.
       :param bodySite: Indicates the site on the subject's body where the observation was made (i.e.
   the target site).
       :param deviceName: The name of the device / manufacturer of the device  that was used to make the
   recording.
       :param device: The device used to collect the media.
       :param height: Height of the image in pixels (photo/video).
       :param width: Width of the image in pixels (photo/video).
       :param frames: The number of frames in a photo. This is used with a multi-page fax, or an
   imaging acquisition context that takes multiple slices in a single image, or
   an animated gif. If there is more than one frame, this SHALL have a value in
   order to alert interface software that a multi-frame capable rendering widget
   is required.
       :param duration: The duration of the recording in seconds - for audio and video.
       :param content: The actual content of the media - inline or by direct reference to the media
   source file.
       :param note: Comments made about the media by the performer, subject or other participants.
