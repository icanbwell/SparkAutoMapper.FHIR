   Appointment
   appointment.xsd
       A booking of a healthcare event among patient(s), practitioner(s), related
   person(s) and/or device(s) for a specific date/time. This may result in one or
   more Encounter(s).
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       A booking of a healthcare event among patient(s), practitioner(s), related
   person(s) and/or device(s) for a specific date/time. This may result in one or
   more Encounter(s).
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: This records identifiers associated with this appointment concern that are
   defined by business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL
   reference to the resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in CDA documents, or
   in written / printed documentation).
       :param status: The overall status of the Appointment. Each of the participants has their own
   participation status which indicates their involvement in the process, however
   this status indicates the shared status.
       :param cancelationReason: The coded reason for the appointment being cancelled. This is often used in
   reporting/billing/futher processing to determine if further actions are
   required, or specific fees apply.
       :param serviceCategory: A broad categorization of the service that is to be performed during this
   appointment.
       :param serviceType: The specific service that is to be performed during this appointment.
       :param specialty: The specialty of a practitioner that would be required to perform the service
   requested in this appointment.
       :param appointmentType: The style of appointment or patient that has been booked in the slot (not
   service type).
       :param reasonCode: The coded reason that this appointment is being scheduled. This is more
   clinical than administrative.
       :param reasonReference: Reason the appointment has been scheduled to take place, as specified using
   information from another resource. When the patient arrives and the encounter
   begins it may be used as the admission diagnosis. The indication will
   typically be a Condition (with other resources referenced in the
   evidence.detail), or a Procedure.
       :param priority: The priority of the appointment. Can be used to make informed decisions if
   needing to re-prioritize appointments. (The iCal Standard specifies 0 as
   undefined, 1 as highest, 9 as lowest priority).
       :param description: The brief description of the appointment as would be shown on a subject line
   in a meeting request, or appointment list. Detailed or expanded information
   should be put in the comment field.
       :param supportingInformation: Additional information to support the appointment provided when making the
   appointment.
       :param start: Date/Time that the appointment is to take place.
       :param end: Date/Time that the appointment is to conclude.
       :param minutesDuration: Number of minutes that the appointment is to take. This can be less than the
   duration between the start and end times.  For example, where the actual time
   of appointment is only an estimate or if a 30 minute appointment is being
   requested, but any time would work.  Also, if there is, for example, a planned
   15 minute break in the middle of a long appointment, the duration may be 15
   minutes less than the difference between the start and end.
       :param slot: The slots from the participants' schedules that will be filled by the
   appointment.
       :param created: The date that this appointment was initially created. This could be different
   to the meta.lastModified value on the initial entry, as this could have been
   before the resource was created on the FHIR server, and should remain
   unchanged over the lifespan of the appointment.
       :param comment: Additional comments about the appointment.
       :param patientInstruction: While Appointment.comment contains information for internal use,
   Appointment.patientInstructions is used to capture patient facing information
   about the Appointment (e.g. please bring your referral or fast from 8pm night
   before).
       :param basedOn: The service request this appointment is allocated to assess (e.g. incoming
   referral or procedure request).
       :param participant: List of participants involved in the appointment.
       :param requestedPeriod: A set of date ranges (potentially including times) that the appointment is
   preferred to be scheduled within.

   The duration (usually in minutes) could also be provided to indicate the
   length of the appointment to fill and populate the start/end times for the
   actual allocated time. However, in other situations the duration may be
   calculated by the scheduling system.
