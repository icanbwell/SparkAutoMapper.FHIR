   FamilyMemberHistory
   familymemberhistory.xsd
       Significant health conditions for a person related to the patient relevant in
   the context of care for the patient.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Significant health conditions for a person related to the patient relevant in
   the context of care for the patient.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this family member history by the performer
   or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and
   propagates from server to server.
       :param instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other
   definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this FamilyMemberHistory.
       :param instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, orderset or
   other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this
   FamilyMemberHistory.
       :param status: A code specifying the status of the record of the family history of a specific
   family member.
       :param dataAbsentReason: Describes why the family member's history is not available.
       :param patient: The person who this history concerns.
       :param date: The date (and possibly time) when the family member history was recorded or
   last updated.
       :param name: This will either be a name or a description; e.g. "Aunt Susan", "my cousin
   with the red hair".
       :param relationship: The type of relationship this person has to the patient (father, mother,
   brother etc.).
       :param sex: The birth sex of the family member.
       :param bornPeriod: None
       :param bornDate: None
       :param bornString: None
       :param ageAge: None
       :param ageRange: None
       :param ageString: None
       :param estimatedAge: If true, indicates that the age value specified is an estimated value.
       :param deceasedBoolean: None
       :param deceasedAge: None
       :param deceasedRange: None
       :param deceasedDate: None
       :param deceasedString: None
       :param reasonCode: Describes why the family member history occurred in coded or textual form.
       :param reasonReference: Indicates a Condition, Observation, AllergyIntolerance, or
   QuestionnaireResponse that justifies this family member history event.
       :param note: This property allows a non condition-specific note to the made about the
   related person. Ideally, the note would be in the condition property, but this
   is not always possible.
       :param condition: The significant Conditions (or condition) that the family member had. This is
   a repeating section to allow a system to represent more than one condition per
   resource, though there is nothing stopping multiple resources - one per
   condition.
