   Coverage
   coverage.xsd
       Financial instrument which may be used to reimburse or pay for health care
   products and services. Includes both insurance and self-payment.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Financial instrument which may be used to reimburse or pay for health care
   products and services. Includes both insurance and self-payment.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this coverage.
       :param status: The status of the resource instance.
       :param type_: The type of coverage: social program, medical plan, accident coverage (workers
   compensation, auto), group health or payment by an individual or organization.
       :param policyHolder: The party who 'owns' the insurance policy.
       :param subscriber: The party who has signed-up for or 'owns' the contractual relationship to the
   policy or to whom the benefit of the policy for services rendered to them or
   their family is due.
       :param subscriberId: The insurer assigned ID for the Subscriber.
       :param beneficiary: The party who benefits from the insurance coverage; the patient when products
   and/or services are provided.
       :param dependent: A unique identifier for a dependent under the coverage.
       :param relationship: The relationship of beneficiary (patient) to the subscriber.
       :param period: Time period during which the coverage is in force. A missing start date
   indicates the start date isn't known, a missing end date means the coverage is
   continuing to be in force.
       :param payor: The program or plan underwriter or payor including both insurance and non-
   insurance agreements, such as patient-pay agreements.
       :param class_: A suite of underwriter specific classifiers.
       :param order: The order of applicability of this coverage relative to other coverages which
   are currently in force. Note, there may be gaps in the numbering and this does
   not imply primary, secondary etc. as the specific positioning of coverages
   depends upon the episode of care.
       :param network: The insurer-specific identifier for the insurer-defined network of providers
   to which the beneficiary may seek treatment which will be covered at the 'in-
   network' rate, otherwise 'out of network' terms and conditions apply.
       :param costToBeneficiary: A suite of codes indicating the cost category and associated amount which have
   been detailed in the policy and may have been  included on the health card.
       :param subrogation: When 'subrogation=true' this insurance instance has been included not for
   adjudication but to provide insurers with the details to recover costs.
       :param contract: The policy(s) which constitute this insurance coverage.
