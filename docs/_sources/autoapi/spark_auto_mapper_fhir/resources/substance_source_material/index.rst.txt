   SubstanceSourceMaterial
   substancesourcematerial.xsd
       Source material shall capture information on the taxonomic and anatomical
   origins as well as the fraction of a material that can result in or can be
   modified to form a substance. This set of data elements shall be used to
   define polymer substances isolated from biological matrices. Taxonomic and
   anatomical origins shall be described using a controlled vocabulary as
   required. This information is captured for naturally derived polymers ( .
   starch) and structurally diverse substances. For Organisms belonging to the
   Kingdom Plantae the Substance level defines the fresh material of a single
   species or infraspecies, the Herbal Drug and the Herbal preparation. For
   Herbal preparations, the fraction information will be captured at the
   Substance information level and additional information for herbal extracts
   will be captured at the Specified Substance Group 1 information level. See for
   further explanation the Substance Class: Structurally Diverse and the herbal
   annex.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

   further explanation the Substance Class: Structurally Diverse and the herbal
   annex.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param sourceMaterialClass: General high level classification of the source material specific to the
   origin of the material.
       :param sourceMaterialType: The type of the source material shall be specified based on a controlled
   vocabulary. For vaccines, this subclause refers to the class of infectious
   agent.
       :param sourceMaterialState: The state of the source material when extracted.
       :param organismId: The unique identifier associated with the source material parent organism
   shall be specified.
       :param organismName: The organism accepted Scientific name shall be provided based on the organism
   taxonomy.
       :param parentSubstanceId: The parent of the herbal drug Ginkgo biloba, Leaf is the substance ID of the
   substance (fresh) of Ginkgo biloba L. or Ginkgo biloba L. (Whole plant).
       :param parentSubstanceName: The parent substance of the Herbal Drug, or Herbal preparation.
       :param countryOfOrigin: The country where the plant material is harvested or the countries where the
   plasma is sourced from as laid down in accordance with the Plasma Master File.
   For “Plasma-derived substances” the attribute country of origin provides
   information about the countries used for the manufacturing of the Cryopoor
   plama or Crioprecipitate.
       :param geographicalLocation: The place/region where the plant is harvested or the places/regions where the
   animal source material has its habitat.
       :param developmentStage: Stage of life for animals, plants, insects and microorganisms. This
   information shall be provided only when the substance is significantly
   different in these stages (e.g. foetal bovine serum).
       :param fractionDescription: Many complex materials are fractions of parts of plants, animals, or minerals.
   Fraction elements are often necessary to define both Substances and Specified
   Group 1 Substances. For substances derived from Plants, fraction information
   will be captured at the Substance information level ( . Oils, Juices and
   Exudates). Additional information for Extracts, such as extraction solvent
   composition, will be captured at the Specified Substance Group 1 information
   level. For plasma-derived products fraction information will be captured at
   the Substance and the Specified Substance Group 1 levels.
       :param organism: This subclause describes the organism which the substance is derived from. For
   vaccines, the parent organism shall be specified based on these subclause
   elements. As an example, full taxonomy will be described for the Substance
   Name: ., Leaf.
       :param partDescription: To do.
