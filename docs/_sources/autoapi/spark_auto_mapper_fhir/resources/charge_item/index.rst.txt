   ChargeItem
   chargeitem.xsd
       The resource ChargeItem describes the provision of healthcare provider
   products for a certain patient, therefore referring not only to the product,
   but containing in addition details of the provision, like date, time, amounts
   and participating organizations and persons. Main Usage of the ChargeItem is
   to enable the billing process and internal cost allocation.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       The resource ChargeItem describes the provision of healthcare provider
   products for a certain patient, therefore referring not only to the product,
   but containing in addition details of the provision, like date, time, amounts
   and participating organizations and persons. Main Usage of the ChargeItem is
   to enable the billing process and internal cost allocation.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Identifiers assigned to this event performer or other systems.
       :param definitionUri: References the (external) source of pricing information, rules of application
   for the code this ChargeItem uses.
       :param definitionCanonical: References the source of pricing information, rules of application for the
   code this ChargeItem uses.
       :param status: The current state of the ChargeItem.
       :param partOf: ChargeItems can be grouped to larger ChargeItems covering the whole set.
       :param code: A code that identifies the charge, like a billing code.
       :param subject: The individual or set of individuals the action is being or was performed on.
       :param context: The encounter or episode of care that establishes the context for this event.
       :param occurrenceDateTime: None
       :param occurrencePeriod: None
       :param occurrenceTiming: None
       :param performer: Indicates who or what performed or participated in the charged service.
       :param performingOrganization: The organization requesting the service.
       :param requestingOrganization: The organization performing the service.
       :param costCenter: The financial cost center permits the tracking of charge attribution.
       :param quantity: Quantity of which the charge item has been serviced.
       :param bodysite: The anatomical location where the related service has been applied.
       :param factorOverride: Factor overriding the factor determined by the rules associated with the code.
       :param priceOverride: Total price of the charge overriding the list price associated with the code.
       :param overrideReason: If the list price or the rule-based factor associated with the code is
   overridden, this attribute can capture a text to indicate the  reason for this
   action.
       :param enterer: The device, practitioner, etc. who entered the charge item.
       :param enteredDate: Date the charge item was entered.
       :param reason: Describes why the event occurred in coded or textual form.
       :param service: Indicated the rendered service that caused this charge.
       :param productReference: None
       :param productCodeableConcept: None
       :param account: Account into which this ChargeItems belongs.
       :param note: Comments made about the event by the performer, subject or other participants.
       :param supportingInformation: Further information supporting this charge.
