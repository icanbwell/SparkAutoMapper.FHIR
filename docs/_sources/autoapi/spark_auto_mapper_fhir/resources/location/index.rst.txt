   Location
   location.xsd
       Details and position information for a physical place where services are
   provided and resources and participants may be stored, found, contained, or
   accommodated.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Details and position information for a physical place where services are
   provided and resources and participants may be stored, found, contained, or
   accommodated.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Unique code or number identifying the location to its users.
       :param status: The status property covers the general availability of the resource, not the
   current value which may be covered by the operationStatus, or by a
   schedule/slots if they are configured for the location.
       :param operationalStatus: The operational status covers operation values most relevant to beds (but can
   also apply to rooms/units/chairs/etc. such as an isolation unit/dialysis
   chair). This typically covers concepts such as contamination, housekeeping,
   and other activities like maintenance.
       :param name: Name of the location as used by humans. Does not need to be unique.
       :param alias: A list of alternate names that the location is known as, or was known as, in
   the past.
       :param description: Description of the Location, which helps in finding or referencing the place.
       :param mode: Indicates whether a resource instance represents a specific location or a
   class of locations.
       :param type_: Indicates the type of function performed at the location.
       :param telecom: The contact details of communication devices available at the location. This
   can include phone numbers, fax numbers, mobile numbers, email addresses and
   web sites.
       :param address: Physical location.
       :param physicalType: Physical form of the location, e.g. building, room, vehicle, road.
       :param position: The absolute geographic location of the Location, expressed using the WGS84
   datum (This is the same co-ordinate system used in KML).
       :param managingOrganization: The organization responsible for the provisioning and upkeep of the location.
       :param partOf: Another Location of which this Location is physically a part of.
       :param hoursOfOperation: What days/times during a week is this location usually open.
       :param availabilityExceptions: A description of when the locations opening ours are different to normal, e.g.
   public holiday availability. Succinctly describing all possible exceptions to
   normal site availability as detailed in the opening hours Times.
       :param endpoint: Technical endpoints providing access to services operated for the location.
