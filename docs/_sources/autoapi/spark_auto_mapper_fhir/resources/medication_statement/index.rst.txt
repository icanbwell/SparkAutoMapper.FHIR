   MedicationStatement
   medicationstatement.xsd
       A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A
   MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication
   now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication
   in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant
   other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario
   where this information is captured is during the history taking process during
   a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from sources
   such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of
   medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.

   The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication
   administration is that the medication administration has complete
   administration information and is based on actual administration information
   from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is
   often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the
   medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported
   the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity,
   or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less
   precise.  As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come
   from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of
   medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication
   administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Identifiers associated with this Medication Statement that are defined by
   business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to
   the resource itself is not appropriate. They are business identifiers assigned
   to this resource by the performer or other systems and remain constant as the
   resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
       :param basedOn: A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this event.
       :param partOf: A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step.
       :param status: A code representing the patient or other source's judgment about the state of
   the medication used that this statement is about.  Generally, this will be
   active or completed.
       :param statusReason: Captures the reason for the current state of the MedicationStatement.
       :param category: Indicates where the medication is expected to be consumed or administered.
       :param medicationCodeableConcept: None
       :param medicationReference: None
       :param subject: The person, animal or group who is/was taking the medication.
       :param context: The encounter or episode of care that establishes the context for this
   MedicationStatement.
       :param effectiveDateTime: None
       :param effectivePeriod: None
       :param dateAsserted: The date when the medication statement was asserted by the information source.
       :param informationSource: The person or organization that provided the information about the taking of
   this medication. Note: Use derivedFrom when a MedicationStatement is derived
   from other resources, e.g. Claim or MedicationRequest.
       :param derivedFrom: Allows linking the MedicationStatement to the underlying MedicationRequest, or
   to other information that supports or is used to derive the
   MedicationStatement.
       :param reasonCode: A reason for why the medication is being/was taken.
       :param reasonReference: Condition or observation that supports why the medication is being/was taken.
       :param note: Provides extra information about the medication statement that is not conveyed
   by the other attributes.
       :param dosage: Indicates how the medication is/was or should be taken by the patient.
