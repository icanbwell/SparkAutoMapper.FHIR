   Composition
   composition.xsd
       A set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a
   single logical package that provides a single coherent statement of meaning,
   establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to
   who is making the statement. A Composition defines the structure and narrative
   content necessary for a document. However, a Composition alone does not
   constitute a document. Rather, the Composition must be the first entry in a
   Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from
   Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example
   Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.).
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

   Bundle where Bundle.type=document, and any other resources referenced from
   Composition must be included as subsequent entries in the Bundle (for example
   Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, etc.).
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: A version-independent identifier for the Composition. This identifier stays
   constant as the composition is changed over time.
       :param status: The workflow/clinical status of this composition. The status is a marker for
   the clinical standing of the document.
       :param type_: Specifies the particular kind of composition (e.g. History and Physical,
   Discharge Summary, Progress Note). This usually equates to the purpose of
   making the composition.
       :param category: A categorization for the type of the composition - helps for indexing and
   searching. This may be implied by or derived from the code specified in the
   Composition Type.
       :param subject: Who or what the composition is about. The composition can be about a person,
   (patient or healthcare practitioner), a device (e.g. a machine) or even a
   group of subjects (such as a document about a herd of livestock, or a set of
   patients that share a common exposure).
       :param encounter: Describes the clinical encounter or type of care this documentation is
   associated with.
       :param date: The composition editing time, when the composition was last logically changed
   by the author.
       :param author: Identifies who is responsible for the information in the composition, not
   necessarily who typed it in.
       :param title: Official human-readable label for the composition.
       :param confidentiality: The code specifying the level of confidentiality of the Composition.
       :param attester: A participant who has attested to the accuracy of the composition/document.
       :param custodian: Identifies the organization or group who is responsible for ongoing
   maintenance of and access to the composition/document information.
       :param relatesTo: Relationships that this composition has with other compositions or documents
   that already exist.
       :param event: The clinical service, such as a colonoscopy or an appendectomy, being
   documented.
       :param section: The root of the sections that make up the composition.
