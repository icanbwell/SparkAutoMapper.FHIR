   MedicinalProduct
   medicinalproduct.xsd
       Detailed definition of a medicinal product, typically for uses other than
   direct patient care (e.g. regulatory use).
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Detailed definition of a medicinal product, typically for uses other than
   direct patient care (e.g. regulatory use).
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Business identifier for this product. Could be an MPID.
       :param type_: Regulatory type, e.g. Investigational or Authorized.
       :param domain: If this medicine applies to human or veterinary uses.
       :param combinedPharmaceuticalDoseForm: The dose form for a single part product, or combined form of a multiple part
   product.
       :param legalStatusOfSupply: The legal status of supply of the medicinal product as classified by the
   regulator.
       :param additionalMonitoringIndicator: Whether the Medicinal Product is subject to additional monitoring for
   regulatory reasons.
       :param specialMeasures: Whether the Medicinal Product is subject to special measures for regulatory
   reasons.
       :param paediatricUseIndicator: If authorised for use in children.
       :param productClassification: Allows the product to be classified by various systems.
       :param marketingStatus: Marketing status of the medicinal product, in contrast to marketing
   authorizaton.
       :param pharmaceuticalProduct: Pharmaceutical aspects of product.
       :param packagedMedicinalProduct: Package representation for the product.
       :param attachedDocument: Supporting documentation, typically for regulatory submission.
       :param masterFile: A master file for to the medicinal product (e.g. Pharmacovigilance System
   Master File).
       :param contact: A product specific contact, person (in a role), or an organization.
       :param clinicalTrial: Clinical trials or studies that this product is involved in.
       :param name: The product's name, including full name and possibly coded parts.
       :param crossReference: Reference to another product, e.g. for linking authorised to investigational
   product.
       :param manufacturingBusinessOperation: An operation applied to the product, for manufacturing or adminsitrative
   purpose.
       :param specialDesignation: Indicates if the medicinal product has an orphan designation for the treatment
   of a rare disease.
