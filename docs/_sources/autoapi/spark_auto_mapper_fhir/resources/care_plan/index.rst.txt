   CarePlan
   careplan.xsd
       Describes the intention of how one or more practitioners intend to deliver
   care for a particular patient, group or community for a period of time,
   possibly limited to care for a specific condition or set of conditions.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Describes the intention of how one or more practitioners intend to deliver
   care for a particular patient, group or community for a period of time,
   possibly limited to care for a specific condition or set of conditions.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this care plan by the performer or other
   systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from
   server to server.
       :param instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, questionnaire or other
   definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this CarePlan.
       :param instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline,
   questionnaire or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by
   this CarePlan.
       :param basedOn: A care plan that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this care plan.
       :param replaces: Completed or terminated care plan whose function is taken by this new care
   plan.
       :param partOf: A larger care plan of which this particular care plan is a component or step.
       :param status: Indicates whether the plan is currently being acted upon, represents future
   intentions or is now a historical record.
       :param intent: Indicates the level of authority/intentionality associated with the care plan
   and where the care plan fits into the workflow chain.
       :param category: Identifies what "kind" of plan this is to support differentiation between
   multiple co-existing plans; e.g. "Home health", "psychiatric", "asthma",
   "disease management", "wellness plan", etc.
       :param title: Human-friendly name for the care plan.
       :param description: A description of the scope and nature of the plan.
       :param subject: Identifies the patient or group whose intended care is described by the plan.
       :param encounter: The Encounter during which this CarePlan was created or to which the creation
   of this record is tightly associated.
       :param period: Indicates when the plan did (or is intended to) come into effect and end.
       :param created: Represents when this particular CarePlan record was created in the system,
   which is often a system-generated date.
       :param author: When populated, the author is responsible for the care plan.  The care plan is
   attributed to the author.
       :param contributor: Identifies the individual(s) or organization who provided the contents of the
   care plan.
       :param careTeam: Identifies all people and organizations who are expected to be involved in the
   care envisioned by this plan.
       :param addresses: Identifies the conditions/problems/concerns/diagnoses/etc. whose management
   and/or mitigation are handled by this plan.
       :param supportingInfo: Identifies portions of the patient's record that specifically influenced the
   formation of the plan.  These might include comorbidities, recent procedures,
   limitations, recent assessments, etc.
       :param goal: Describes the intended objective(s) of carrying out the care plan.
       :param activity: Identifies a planned action to occur as part of the plan.  For example, a
   medication to be used, lab tests to perform, self-monitoring, education, etc.
       :param note: General notes about the care plan not covered elsewhere.
