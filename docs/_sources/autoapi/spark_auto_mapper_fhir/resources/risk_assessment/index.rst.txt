   RiskAssessment
   riskassessment.xsd
       An assessment of the likely outcome(s) for a patient or other subject as well
   as the likelihood of each outcome.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       An assessment of the likely outcome(s) for a patient or other subject as well
   as the likelihood of each outcome.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Business identifier assigned to the risk assessment.
       :param basedOn: A reference to the request that is fulfilled by this risk assessment.
       :param parent: A reference to a resource that this risk assessment is part of, such as a
   Procedure.
       :param status: The status of the RiskAssessment, using the same statuses as an Observation.
       :param method: The algorithm, process or mechanism used to evaluate the risk.
       :param code: The type of the risk assessment performed.
       :param subject: The patient or group the risk assessment applies to.
       :param encounter: The encounter where the assessment was performed.
       :param occurrenceDateTime: None
       :param occurrencePeriod: None
       :param condition: For assessments or prognosis specific to a particular condition, indicates the
   condition being assessed.
       :param performer: The provider or software application that performed the assessment.
       :param reasonCode: The reason the risk assessment was performed.
       :param reasonReference: Resources supporting the reason the risk assessment was performed.
       :param basis: Indicates the source data considered as part of the assessment (for example,
   FamilyHistory, Observations, Procedures, Conditions, etc.).
       :param prediction: Describes the expected outcome for the subject.
       :param mitigation: A description of the steps that might be taken to reduce the identified
   risk(s).
       :param note: Additional comments about the risk assessment.
