   ClaimResponse
   claimresponse.xsd
       This resource provides the adjudication details from the processing of a Claim
   resource.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       This resource provides the adjudication details from the processing of a Claim
   resource.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this claim response.
       :param status: The status of the resource instance.
       :param type_: A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional
   information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
       :param subType: A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional
   information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
       :param use: A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: to request
   adjudication of products and services previously rendered; or requesting
   authorization and adjudication for provision in the future; or requesting the
   non-binding adjudication of the listed products and services which could be
   provided in the future.
       :param patient: The party to whom the professional services and/or products have been supplied
   or are being considered and for whom actual for facast reimbursement is
   sought.

   preauthorization.
       :param request: Original request resource reference.

       :param disposition: A human readable description of the status of the adjudication.
       :param preAuthRef: Reference from the Insurer which is used in later communications which refers
   to this adjudication.
       :param preAuthPeriod: The time frame during which this authorization is effective.
       :param payeeType: Type of Party to be reimbursed: subscriber, provider, other.

   which can also be a simple items or groups of sub-details.
       :param addItem: The first-tier service adjudications for payor added product or service lines.

       :param payment: Payment details for the adjudication of the claim.
