   DocumentReference
   documentreference.xsd
       A reference to a document of any kind for any purpose. Provides metadata about
   the document so that the document can be discovered and managed. The scope of
   a document is any seralized object with a mime-type, so includes formal
   patient centric documents (CDA), cliical notes, scanned paper, and non-patient
   specific documents like policy text.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       A reference to a document of any kind for any purpose. Provides metadata about
   the document so that the document can be discovered and managed. The scope of
   a document is any seralized object with a mime-type, so includes formal
   patient centric documents (CDA), cliical notes, scanned paper, and non-patient
   specific documents like policy text.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param masterIdentifier: Document identifier as assigned by the source of the document. This identifier
   is specific to this version of the document. This unique identifier may be
   used elsewhere to identify this version of the document.
       :param identifier: Other identifiers associated with the document, including version independent
   identifiers.
       :param status: The status of this document reference.
       :param docStatus: The status of the underlying document.
       :param type_: Specifies the particular kind of document referenced  (e.g. History and
   Physical, Discharge Summary, Progress Note). This usually equates to the
   purpose of making the document referenced.
       :param category: A categorization for the type of document referenced - helps for indexing and
   searching. This may be implied by or derived from the code specified in the
   DocumentReference.type.
       :param subject: Who or what the document is about. The document can be about a person,
   (patient or healthcare practitioner), a device (e.g. a machine) or even a
   group of subjects (such as a document about a herd of farm animals, or a set
   of patients that share a common exposure).
       :param date: When the document reference was created.
       :param author: Identifies who is responsible for adding the information to the document.
       :param authenticator: Which person or organization authenticates that this document is valid.
       :param custodian: Identifies the organization or group who is responsible for ongoing
   maintenance of and access to the document.
       :param relatesTo: Relationships that this document has with other document references that
   already exist.
       :param description: Human-readable description of the source document.
       :param securityLabel: A set of Security-Tag codes specifying the level of privacy/security of the
   Document. Note that DocumentReference.meta.security contains the security
   labels of the "reference" to the document, while
   DocumentReference.securityLabel contains a snapshot of the security labels on
   the document the reference refers to.
       :param content: The document and format referenced. There may be multiple content element
   repetitions, each with a different format.
       :param context: The clinical context in which the document was prepared.
