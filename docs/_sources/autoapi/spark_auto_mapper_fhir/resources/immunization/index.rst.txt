   Immunization
   immunization.xsd
       Describes the event of a patient being administered a vaccine or a record of
   an immunization as reported by a patient, a clinician or another party.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Describes the event of a patient being administered a vaccine or a record of
   an immunization as reported by a patient, a clinician or another party.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this immunization record.
       :param status: Indicates the current status of the immunization event.
       :param statusReason: Indicates the reason the immunization event was not performed.
       :param vaccineCode: Vaccine that was administered or was to be administered.
       :param patient: The patient who either received or did not receive the immunization.
       :param encounter: The visit or admission or other contact between patient and health care
   provider the immunization was performed as part of.
       :param occurrenceDateTime: None
       :param occurrenceString: None
       :param recorded: The date the occurrence of the immunization was first captured in the record -
   potentially significantly after the occurrence of the event.
       :param primarySource: An indication that the content of the record is based on information from the
   person who administered the vaccine. This reflects the context under which the
   data was originally recorded.
       :param reportOrigin: The source of the data when the report of the immunization event is not based
   on information from the person who administered the vaccine.
       :param location: The service delivery location where the vaccine administration occurred.
       :param manufacturer: Name of vaccine manufacturer.
       :param lotNumber: Lot number of the  vaccine product.
       :param expirationDate: Date vaccine batch expires.
       :param site: Body site where vaccine was administered.
       :param route: The path by which the vaccine product is taken into the body.
       :param doseQuantity: The quantity of vaccine product that was administered.
       :param performer: Indicates who performed the immunization event.
       :param note: Extra information about the immunization that is not conveyed by the other
   attributes.
       :param reasonCode: Reasons why the vaccine was administered.
       :param reasonReference: Condition, Observation or DiagnosticReport that supports why the immunization
   was administered.
       :param isSubpotent: Indication if a dose is considered to be subpotent. By default, a dose should
   be considered to be potent.
       :param subpotentReason: Reason why a dose is considered to be subpotent.
       :param education: Educational material presented to the patient (or guardian) at the time of
   vaccine administration.
       :param programEligibility: Indicates a patient's eligibility for a funding program.
       :param fundingSource: Indicates the source of the vaccine actually administered. This may be
   different than the patient eligibility (e.g. the patient may be eligible for a
   publically purchased vaccine but due to inventory issues, vaccine purchased
   with private funds was actually administered).
       :param reaction: Categorical data indicating that an adverse event is associated in time to an
   immunization.
       :param protocolApplied: The protocol (set of recommendations) being followed by the provider who
   administered the dose.
