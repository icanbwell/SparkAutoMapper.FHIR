   SubstanceNucleicAcid
   substancenucleicacid.xsd
       Nucleic acids are defined by three distinct elements: the base, sugar and
   linkage. Individual substance/moiety IDs will be created for each of these
   elements. The nucleotide sequence will be always entered in the 5’-3’
   direction.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Nucleic acids are defined by three distinct elements: the base, sugar and

   elements. The nucleotide sequence will be always entered in the 5’-3’
   direction.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param sequenceType: The type of the sequence shall be specified based on a controlled vocabulary.
       :param numberOfSubunits: The number of linear sequences of nucleotides linked through phosphodiester
   bonds shall be described. Subunits would be strands of nucleic acids that are
   tightly associated typically through Watson-Crick base pairing. NOTE: If not
   specified in the reference source, the assumption is that there is 1 subunit.
       :param areaOfHybridisation: The area of hybridisation shall be described if applicable for double stranded
   RNA or DNA. The number associated with the subunit followed by the number
   associated to the residue shall be specified in increasing order. The
   underscore “” shall be used as separator as follows: “Subunitnumber Residue”.
       :param oligoNucleotideType: (TBC).
       :param subunit: Subunits are listed in order of decreasing length; sequences of the same
   length will be ordered by molecular weight; subunits that have identical
   sequences will be repeated multiple times.
