   OrganizationAffiliation
   organizationaffiliation.xsd
       Defines an affiliation/assotiation/relationship between 2 distinct
   oganizations, that is not a part-of relationship/sub-division relationship.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Defines an affiliation/assotiation/relationship between 2 distinct
   oganizations, that is not a part-of relationship/sub-division relationship.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Business identifiers that are specific to this role.
       :param active: Whether this organization affiliation record is in active use.
       :param period: The period during which the participatingOrganization is affiliated with the
   primary organization.
       :param organization: Organization where the role is available (primary organization/has members).
       :param participatingOrganization: The Participating Organization provides/performs the role(s) defined by the
   code to the Primary Organization (e.g. providing services or is a member of).
       :param network: Health insurance provider network in which the participatingOrganization
   provides the role's services (if defined) at the indicated locations (if
   defined).
       :param code: Definition of the role the participatingOrganization plays in the association.
       :param specialty: Specific specialty of the participatingOrganization in the context of the
   role.
       :param location: The location(s) at which the role occurs.
       :param healthcareService: Healthcare services provided through the role.
       :param telecom: Contact details at the participatingOrganization relevant to this Affiliation.
       :param endpoint: Technical endpoints providing access to services operated for this role.
