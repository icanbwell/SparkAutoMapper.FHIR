   AdverseEvent
   adverseevent.xsd
       Actual or  potential/avoided event causing unintended physical injury
   resulting from or contributed to by medical care, a research study or other
   healthcare setting factors that requires additional monitoring, treatment, or
   hospitalization, or that results in death.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Actual or  potential/avoided event causing unintended physical injury
   resulting from or contributed to by medical care, a research study or other
   healthcare setting factors that requires additional monitoring, treatment, or
   hospitalization, or that results in death.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this adverse event by the performer or other
   systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from
   server to server.
       :param actuality: Whether the event actually happened, or just had the potential to. Note that
   this is independent of whether anyone was affected or harmed or how severely.
       :param category: The overall type of event, intended for search and filtering purposes.
       :param event: This element defines the specific type of event that occurred or that was
   prevented from occurring.
       :param subject: This subject or group impacted by the event.
       :param encounter: The Encounter during which AdverseEvent was created or to which the creation
   of this record is tightly associated.
       :param date: The date (and perhaps time) when the adverse event occurred.
       :param detected: Estimated or actual date the AdverseEvent began, in the opinion of the
   reporter.
       :param recordedDate: The date on which the existence of the AdverseEvent was first recorded.
       :param resultingCondition: Includes information about the reaction that occurred as a result of exposure
   to a substance (for example, a drug or a chemical).
       :param location: The information about where the adverse event occurred.
       :param seriousness: Assessment whether this event was of real importance.
       :param severity: Describes the severity of the adverse event, in relation to the subject.
   Contrast to AdverseEvent.seriousness - a severe rash might not be serious, but
   a mild heart problem is.
       :param outcome: Describes the type of outcome from the adverse event.
       :param recorder: Information on who recorded the adverse event.  May be the patient or a
   practitioner.
       :param contributor: Parties that may or should contribute or have contributed information to the
   adverse event, which can consist of one or more activities.  Such information
   includes information leading to the decision to perform the activity and how
   to perform the activity (e.g. consultant), information that the activity
   itself seeks to reveal (e.g. informant of clinical history), or information
   about what activity was performed (e.g. informant witness).
       :param suspectEntity: Describes the entity that is suspected to have caused the adverse event.
       :param subjectMedicalHistory: AdverseEvent.subjectMedicalHistory.
       :param referenceDocument: AdverseEvent.referenceDocument.
       :param study: AdverseEvent.study.
