   ImagingStudy
   imagingstudy.xsd
       Representation of the content produced in a DICOM imaging study. A study
   comprises a set of series, each of which includes a set of Service-Object Pair
   Instances (SOP Instances - images or other data) acquired or produced in a
   common context.  A series is of only one modality (e.g. X-ray, CT, MR,
   ultrasound), but a study may have multiple series of different modalities.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Representation of the content produced in a DICOM imaging study. A study
   comprises a set of series, each of which includes a set of Service-Object Pair
   Instances (SOP Instances - images or other data) acquired or produced in a
   common context.  A series is of only one modality (e.g. X-ray, CT, MR,
   ultrasound), but a study may have multiple series of different modalities.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Identifiers for the ImagingStudy such as DICOM Study Instance UID, and
   Accession Number.
       :param status: The current state of the ImagingStudy.
       :param modality: A list of all the series.modality values that are actual acquisition
   modalities, i.e. those in the DICOM Context Group 29 (value set OID
   1.2.840.10008.6.1.19).
       :param subject: The subject, typically a patient, of the imaging study.
       :param encounter: The healthcare event (e.g. a patient and healthcare provider interaction)
   during which this ImagingStudy is made.
       :param started: Date and time the study started.
       :param basedOn: A list of the diagnostic requests that resulted in this imaging study being
   performed.
       :param referrer: The requesting/referring physician.
       :param interpreter: Who read the study and interpreted the images or other content.
       :param endpoint: The network service providing access (e.g., query, view, or retrieval) for the
   study. See implementation notes for information about using DICOM endpoints. A
   study-level endpoint applies to each series in the study, unless overridden by
   a series-level endpoint with the same Endpoint.connectionType.
       :param numberOfSeries: Number of Series in the Study. This value given may be larger than the number
   of series elements this Resource contains due to resource availability,
   security, or other factors. This element should be present if any series
   elements are present.
       :param numberOfInstances: Number of SOP Instances in Study. This value given may be larger than the
   number of instance elements this resource contains due to resource
   availability, security, or other factors. This element should be present if
   any instance elements are present.
       :param procedureReference: The procedure which this ImagingStudy was part of.
       :param procedureCode: The code for the performed procedure type.
       :param location: The principal physical location where the ImagingStudy was performed.
       :param reasonCode: Description of clinical condition indicating why the ImagingStudy was
   requested.
       :param reasonReference: Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this Study.
       :param note: Per the recommended DICOM mapping, this element is derived from the Study
   Description attribute (0008,1030). Observations or findings about the imaging
   study should be recorded in another resource, e.g. Observation, and not in
   this element.
       :param description: The Imaging Manager description of the study. Institution-generated
   description or classification of the Study (component) performed.
       :param series: Each study has one or more series of images or other content.
