   RelatedPerson
   relatedperson.xsd
       Information about a person that is involved in the care for a patient, but who
   is not the target of healthcare, nor has a formal responsibility in the care
   process.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Information about a person that is involved in the care for a patient, but who
   is not the target of healthcare, nor has a formal responsibility in the care
   process.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Identifier for a person within a particular scope.
       :param active: Whether this related person record is in active use.
       :param patient: The patient this person is related to.
       :param relationship: The nature of the relationship between a patient and the related person.
       :param name: A name associated with the person.
       :param telecom: A contact detail for the person, e.g. a telephone number or an email address.
       :param gender: Administrative Gender - the gender that the person is considered to have for
   administration and record keeping purposes.
       :param birthDate: The date on which the related person was born.
       :param address: Address where the related person can be contacted or visited.
       :param photo: Image of the person.
       :param period: The period of time during which this relationship is or was active. If there
   are no dates defined, then the interval is unknown.
       :param communication: A language which may be used to communicate with about the patient's health.
