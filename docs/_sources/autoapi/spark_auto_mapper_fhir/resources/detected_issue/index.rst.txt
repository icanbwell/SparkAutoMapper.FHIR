   DetectedIssue
   detectedissue.xsd
       Indicates an actual or potential clinical issue with or between one or more
   active or proposed clinical actions for a patient; e.g. Drug-drug interaction,
   Ineffective treatment frequency, Procedure-condition conflict, etc.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Indicates an actual or potential clinical issue with or between one or more
   active or proposed clinical actions for a patient; e.g. Drug-drug interaction,
   Ineffective treatment frequency, Procedure-condition conflict, etc.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Business identifier associated with the detected issue record.
       :param status: Indicates the status of the detected issue.
       :param code: Identifies the general type of issue identified.
       :param severity: Indicates the degree of importance associated with the identified issue based
   on the potential impact on the patient.
       :param patient: Indicates the patient whose record the detected issue is associated with.
       :param identifiedDateTime: None
       :param identifiedPeriod: None
       :param author: Individual or device responsible for the issue being raised.  For example, a
   decision support application or a pharmacist conducting a medication review.
       :param implicated: Indicates the resource representing the current activity or proposed activity
   that is potentially problematic.
       :param evidence: Supporting evidence or manifestations that provide the basis for identifying
   the detected issue such as a GuidanceResponse or MeasureReport.
       :param detail: A textual explanation of the detected issue.
       :param reference: The literature, knowledge-base or similar reference that describes the
   propensity for the detected issue identified.
       :param mitigation: Indicates an action that has been taken or is committed to reduce or eliminate
   the likelihood of the risk identified by the detected issue from manifesting.
   Can also reflect an observation of known mitigating factors that may
   reduce/eliminate the need for any action.
