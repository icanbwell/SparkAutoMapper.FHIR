   DeviceDefinition
   devicedefinition.xsd
       The characteristics, operational status and capabilities of a medical-related
   component of a medical device.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       The characteristics, operational status and capabilities of a medical-related
   component of a medical device.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Unique instance identifiers assigned to a device by the software,
   manufacturers, other organizations or owners. For example: handle ID.
       :param udiDeviceIdentifier: Unique device identifier (UDI) assigned to device label or package.  Note that
   the Device may include multiple udiCarriers as it either may include just the
   udiCarrier for the jurisdiction it is sold, or for multiple jurisdictions it
   could have been sold.
       :param manufacturerString: None
       :param manufacturerReference: None
       :param deviceName: A name given to the device to identify it.
       :param modelNumber: The model number for the device.
       :param type_: What kind of device or device system this is.
       :param specialization: The capabilities supported on a  device, the standards to which the device
   conforms for a particular purpose, and used for the communication.
       :param version: The available versions of the device, e.g., software versions.
       :param safety: Safety characteristics of the device.
       :param shelfLifeStorage: Shelf Life and storage information.
       :param physicalCharacteristics: Dimensions, color etc.
       :param languageCode: Language code for the human-readable text strings produced by the device (all
   supported).
       :param capability: Device capabilities.
       :param property: The actual configuration settings of a device as it actually operates, e.g.,
   regulation status, time properties.
       :param owner: An organization that is responsible for the provision and ongoing maintenance
   of the device.
       :param contact: Contact details for an organization or a particular human that is responsible
   for the device.
       :param url: A network address on which the device may be contacted directly.
       :param onlineInformation: Access to on-line information about the device.
       :param note: Descriptive information, usage information or implantation information that is
   not captured in an existing element.
       :param quantity: The quantity of the device present in the packaging (e.g. the number of
   devices present in a pack, or the number of devices in the same package of the
   medicinal product).
       :param parentDevice: The parent device it can be part of.
       :param material: A substance used to create the material(s) of which the device is made.
