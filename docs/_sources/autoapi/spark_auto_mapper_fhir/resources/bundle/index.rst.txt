   Bundle
   bundle.xsd
       A container for a collection of resources.

       A container for a collection of resources.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param identifier: A persistent identifier for the bundle that won't change as a bundle is copied
   from server to server.
       :param type_: Indicates the purpose of this bundle - how it is intended to be used.
       :param timestamp: The date/time that the bundle was assembled - i.e. when the resources were
   placed in the bundle.
       :param total: If a set of search matches, this is the total number of entries of type
   'match' across all pages in the search.  It does not include search.mode =
   'include' or 'outcome' entries and it does not provide a count of the number
   of entries in the Bundle.
       :param link: A series of links that provide context to this bundle.
       :param entry: An entry in a bundle resource - will either contain a resource or information
   about a resource (transactions and history only).
       :param signature: Digital Signature - base64 encoded. XML-DSig or a JWT.
