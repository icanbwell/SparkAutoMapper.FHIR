   Specimen
   specimen.xsd
       A sample to be used for analysis.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       A sample to be used for analysis.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Id for specimen.
       :param accessionIdentifier: The identifier assigned by the lab when accessioning specimen(s). This is not
   necessarily the same as the specimen identifier, depending on local lab
   procedures.
       :param status: The availability of the specimen.
       :param type_: The kind of material that forms the specimen.
       :param subject: Where the specimen came from. This may be from patient(s), from a location
   (e.g., the source of an environmental sample), or a sampling of a substance or
   a device.
       :param receivedTime: Time when specimen was received for processing or testing.
       :param parent: Reference to the parent (source) specimen which is used when the specimen was
   either derived from or a component of another specimen.
       :param request: Details concerning a service request that required a specimen to be collected.
       :param collection: Details concerning the specimen collection.
       :param processing: Details concerning processing and processing steps for the specimen.
       :param container: The container holding the specimen.  The recursive nature of containers; i.e.
   blood in tube in tray in rack is not addressed here.
       :param condition: A mode or state of being that describes the nature of the specimen.
       :param note: To communicate any details or issues about the specimen or during the specimen
   collection. (for example: broken vial, sent with patient, frozen).
