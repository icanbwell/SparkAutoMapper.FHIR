   PaymentNotice
   paymentnotice.xsd
       This resource provides the status of the payment for goods and services
   rendered, and the request and response resource references.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       This resource provides the status of the payment for goods and services
   rendered, and the request and response resource references.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this payment notice.
       :param status: The status of the resource instance.
       :param request: Reference of resource for which payment is being made.
       :param response: Reference of response to resource for which payment is being made.
       :param created: The date when this resource was created.
       :param provider: The practitioner who is responsible for the services rendered to the patient.
       :param payment: A reference to the payment which is the subject of this notice.
       :param paymentDate: The date when the above payment action occurred.
       :param payee: The party who will receive or has received payment that is the subject of this
   notification.
       :param recipient: The party who is notified of the payment status.
       :param amount: The amount sent to the payee.
       :param paymentStatus: A code indicating whether payment has been sent or cleared.
