   DeviceUseStatement
   deviceusestatement.xsd
       A record of a device being used by a patient where the record is the result of
   a report from the patient or another clinician.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       A record of a device being used by a patient where the record is the result of
   a report from the patient or another clinician.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: An external identifier for this statement such as an IRI.
       :param basedOn: A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this
   DeviceUseStatement.
       :param status: A code representing the patient or other source's judgment about the state of
   the device used that this statement is about.  Generally this will be active
   or completed.
       :param subject: The patient who used the device.
       :param derivedFrom: Allows linking the DeviceUseStatement to the underlying Request, or to other
   information that supports or is used to derive the DeviceUseStatement.
       :param timingTiming: None
       :param timingPeriod: None
       :param timingDateTime: None
       :param recordedOn: The time at which the statement was made/recorded.
       :param source: Who reported the device was being used by the patient.
       :param device: The details of the device used.
       :param reasonCode: Reason or justification for the use of the device.
       :param reasonReference: Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this DeviceUseStatement.
       :param bodySite: Indicates the anotomic location on the subject's body where the device was
   used ( i.e. the target).
       :param note: Details about the device statement that were not represented at all or
   sufficiently in one of the attributes provided in a class. These may include
   for example a comment, an instruction, or a note associated with the
   statement.
