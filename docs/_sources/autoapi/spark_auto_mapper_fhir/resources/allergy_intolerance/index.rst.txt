   AllergyIntolerance
   allergyintolerance.xsd
       Risk of harmful or undesirable, physiological response which is unique to an
   individual and associated with exposure to a substance.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Risk of harmful or undesirable, physiological response which is unique to an
   individual and associated with exposure to a substance.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this AllergyIntolerance by the performer or
   other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates
   from server to server.
       :param clinicalStatus: The clinical status of the allergy or intolerance.
       :param verificationStatus: Assertion about certainty associated with the propensity, or potential risk,
   of a reaction to the identified substance (including pharmaceutical product).
       :param type_: Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for the reaction
   risk.
       :param category: Category of the identified substance.
       :param criticality: Estimate of the potential clinical harm, or seriousness, of the reaction to
   the identified substance.
       :param code: Code for an allergy or intolerance statement (either a positive or a
   negated/excluded statement).  This may be a code for a substance or
   pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse
   reaction risk (e.g., "Latex"), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g.,
   "Latex allergy"), or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class
   (e.g., "No latex allergy") or a general or categorical negated statement
   (e.g.,  "No known allergy", "No known drug allergies").  Note: the substance
   for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the
   cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be
   a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product
   that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only
   process the 'code' and ignore the 'reaction.substance'.  If a receiving system
   is unable to confirm that AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within
   the semantic scope of AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system
   should ignore AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.
       :param patient: The patient who has the allergy or intolerance.
       :param encounter: The encounter when the allergy or intolerance was asserted.
       :param onsetDateTime: None
       :param onsetAge: None
       :param onsetPeriod: None
       :param onsetRange: None
       :param onsetString: None
       :param recordedDate: The recordedDate represents when this particular AllergyIntolerance record was
   created in the system, which is often a system-generated date.
       :param recorder: Individual who recorded the record and takes responsibility for its content.
       :param asserter: The source of the information about the allergy that is recorded.
       :param lastOccurrence: Represents the date and/or time of the last known occurrence of a reaction
   event.
       :param note: Additional narrative about the propensity for the Adverse Reaction, not
   captured in other fields.
       :param reaction: Details about each adverse reaction event linked to exposure to the identified
   substance.
