   Observation
   observation.xsd
       Measurements and simple assertions made about a patient, device or other
   subject.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Measurements and simple assertions made about a patient, device or other
   subject.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this observation.
       :param basedOn: A plan, proposal or order that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this event.
   For example, a MedicationRequest may require a patient to have laboratory test
   performed before  it is dispensed.
       :param partOf: A larger event of which this particular Observation is a component or step.
   For example,  an observation as part of a procedure.
       :param status: The status of the result value.
       :param category: A code that classifies the general type of observation being made.
       :param code: Describes what was observed. Sometimes this is called the observation "name".
       :param subject: The patient, or group of patients, location, or device this observation is
   about and into whose record the observation is placed. If the actual focus of
   the observation is different from the subject (or a sample of, part, or region
   of the subject), the `focus` element or the `code` itself specifies the actual
   focus of the observation.
       :param focus: The actual focus of an observation when it is not the patient of record
   representing something or someone associated with the patient such as a
   spouse, parent, fetus, or donor. For example, fetus observations in a mother's
   record.  The focus of an observation could also be an existing condition,  an
   intervention, the subject's diet,  another observation of the subject,  or a
   body structure such as tumor or implanted device.   An example use case would
   be using the Observation resource to capture whether the mother is trained to
   change her child's tracheostomy tube. In this example, the child is the
   patient of record and the mother is the focus.
       :param encounter: The healthcare event  (e.g. a patient and healthcare provider interaction)
   during which this observation is made.
       :param effectiveDateTime: None
       :param effectivePeriod: None
       :param effectiveTiming: None
       :param effectiveInstant: None
       :param issued: The date and time this version of the observation was made available to
   providers, typically after the results have been reviewed and verified.
       :param performer: Who was responsible for asserting the observed value as "true".
       :param valueQuantity: None
       :param valueCodeableConcept: None
       :param valueString: None
       :param valueBoolean: None
       :param valueInteger: None
       :param valueRange: None
       :param valueRatio: None
       :param valueSampledData: None
       :param valueTime: None
       :param valueDateTime: None
       :param valuePeriod: None
       :param dataAbsentReason: Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.value[x]
   is missing.
       :param interpretation: A categorical assessment of an observation value.  For example, high, low,
   normal.
       :param note: Comments about the observation or the results.
       :param bodySite: Indicates the site on the subject's body where the observation was made (i.e.
   the target site).
       :param method: Indicates the mechanism used to perform the observation.
       :param specimen: The specimen that was used when this observation was made.
       :param device: The device used to generate the observation data.
       :param referenceRange: Guidance on how to interpret the value by comparison to a normal or
   recommended range.  Multiple reference ranges are interpreted as an "OR".   In
   other words, to represent two distinct target populations, two
   `referenceRange` elements would be used.
       :param hasMember: This observation is a group observation (e.g. a battery, a panel of tests, a
   set of vital sign measurements) that includes the target as a member of the
   group.
       :param derivedFrom: The target resource that represents a measurement from which this observation
   value is derived. For example, a calculated anion gap or a fetal measurement
   based on an ultrasound image.
       :param component: Some observations have multiple component observations.  These component
   observations are expressed as separate code value pairs that share the same
   attributes.  Examples include systolic and diastolic component observations
   for blood pressure measurement and multiple component observations for
   genetics observations.
