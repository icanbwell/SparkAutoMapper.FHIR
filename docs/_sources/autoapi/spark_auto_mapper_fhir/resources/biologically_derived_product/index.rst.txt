   BiologicallyDerivedProduct
   biologicallyderivedproduct.xsd
       A material substance originating from a biological entity intended to be
   transplanted or infused
   into another (possibly the same) biological entity.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       A material substance originating from a biological entity intended to be
   transplanted or infused
   into another (possibly the same) biological entity.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: This records identifiers associated with this biologically derived product
   instance that are defined by business processes and/or used to refer to it
   when a direct URL reference to the resource itself is not appropriate (e.g. in
   CDA documents, or in written / printed documentation).
       :param productCategory: Broad category of this product.
       :param productCode: A code that identifies the kind of this biologically derived product (SNOMED
   Ctcode).
       :param status: Whether the product is currently available.
       :param request: Procedure request to obtain this biologically derived product.
       :param quantity: Number of discrete units within this product.
       :param parent: Parent product (if any).
       :param collection: How this product was collected.
       :param processing: Any processing of the product during collection that does not change the
   fundamental nature of the product. For example adding anti-coagulants during
   the collection of Peripheral Blood Stem Cells.
       :param manipulation: Any manipulation of product post-collection that is intended to alter the
   product.  For example a buffy-coat enrichment or CD8 reduction of Peripheral
   Blood Stem Cells to make it more suitable for infusion.
       :param storage: Product storage.
