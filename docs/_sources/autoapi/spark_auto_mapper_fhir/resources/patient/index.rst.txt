   Patient
   patient.xsd
       Demographics and other administrative information about an individual or
   animal receiving care or other health-related services.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Demographics and other administrative information about an individual or
   animal receiving care or other health-related services.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: An identifier for this patient.
       :param active: Whether this patient record is in active use.
   Many systems use this property to mark as non-current patients, such as those
   that have not been seen for a period of time based on an organization's
   business rules.

   It is often used to filter patient lists to exclude inactive patients

   Deceased patients may also be marked as inactive for the same reasons, but may
   be active for some time after death.
       :param name: A name associated with the individual.
       :param telecom: A contact detail (e.g. a telephone number or an email address) by which the
   individual may be contacted.
       :param gender: Administrative Gender - the gender that the patient is considered to have for
   administration and record keeping purposes.
       :param birthDate: The date of birth for the individual.
       :param deceasedBoolean: None
       :param deceasedDateTime: None
       :param address: An address for the individual.
       :param maritalStatus: This field contains a patient's most recent marital (civil) status.
       :param multipleBirthBoolean: None
       :param multipleBirthInteger: None
       :param photo: Image of the patient.
       :param contact: A contact party (e.g. guardian, partner, friend) for the patient.
       :param communication: A language which may be used to communicate with the patient about his or her
   health.
       :param generalPractitioner: Patient's nominated care provider.
       :param managingOrganization: Organization that is the custodian of the patient record.
       :param link: Link to another patient resource that concerns the same actual patient.
