   EpisodeOfCare
   episodeofcare.xsd
       An association between a patient and an organization / healthcare provider(s)
   during which time encounters may occur. The managing organization assumes a
   level of responsibility for the patient during this time.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       An association between a patient and an organization / healthcare provider(s)
   during which time encounters may occur. The managing organization assumes a
   level of responsibility for the patient during this time.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: The EpisodeOfCare may be known by different identifiers for different contexts
   of use, such as when an external agency is tracking the Episode for funding
   purposes.
       :param status: planned | waitlist | active | onhold | finished | cancelled.
       :param statusHistory: The history of statuses that the EpisodeOfCare has been through (without
   requiring processing the history of the resource).
       :param type_: A classification of the type of episode of care; e.g. specialist referral,
   disease management, type of funded care.
       :param diagnosis: The list of diagnosis relevant to this episode of care.
       :param patient: The patient who is the focus of this episode of care.
       :param managingOrganization: The organization that has assumed the specific responsibilities for the
   specified duration.
       :param period: The interval during which the managing organization assumes the defined
   responsibility.
       :param referralRequest: Referral Request(s) that are fulfilled by this EpisodeOfCare, incoming
   referrals.
       :param careManager: The practitioner that is the care manager/care coordinator for this patient.
       :param team: The list of practitioners that may be facilitating this episode of care for
   specific purposes.
       :param account: The set of accounts that may be used for billing for this EpisodeOfCare.
