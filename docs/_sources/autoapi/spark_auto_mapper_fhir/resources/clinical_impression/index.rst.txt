   ClinicalImpression
   clinicalimpression.xsd
       A record of a clinical assessment performed to determine what problem(s) may
   affect the patient and before planning the treatments or management strategies
   that are best to manage a patient's condition. Assessments are often 1:1 with
   a clinical consultation / encounter,  but this varies greatly depending on the
   clinical workflow. This resource is called "ClinicalImpression" rather than
   "ClinicalAssessment" to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools
   such as Apgar score.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       A record of a clinical assessment performed to determine what problem(s) may

   clinical workflow. This resource is called "ClinicalImpression" rather than
   "ClinicalAssessment" to avoid confusion with the recording of assessment tools
   such as Apgar score.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this clinical impression by the performer or
   other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates
   from server to server.
       :param status: Identifies the workflow status of the assessment.
       :param statusReason: Captures the reason for the current state of the ClinicalImpression.
       :param code: Categorizes the type of clinical assessment performed.
       :param description: A summary of the context and/or cause of the assessment - why / where it was
   performed, and what patient events/status prompted it.
       :param subject: The patient or group of individuals assessed as part of this record.
       :param encounter: The Encounter during which this ClinicalImpression was created or to which the
   creation of this record is tightly associated.
       :param effectiveDateTime: None
       :param effectivePeriod: None
       :param date: Indicates when the documentation of the assessment was complete.
       :param assessor: The clinician performing the assessment.
       :param previous: A reference to the last assessment that was conducted on this patient.
   Assessments are often/usually ongoing in nature; a care provider (practitioner
   or team) will make new assessments on an ongoing basis as new data arises or
   the patient's conditions changes.
       :param problem: A list of the relevant problems/conditions for a patient.
       :param investigation: One or more sets of investigations (signs, symptoms, etc.). The actual
   grouping of investigations varies greatly depending on the type and context of
   the assessment. These investigations may include data generated during the
   assessment process, or data previously generated and recorded that is
   pertinent to the outcomes.
       :param protocol: Reference to a specific published clinical protocol that was followed during
   this assessment, and/or that provides evidence in support of the diagnosis.
       :param summary: A text summary of the investigations and the diagnosis.
       :param finding: Specific findings or diagnoses that were considered likely or relevant to
   ongoing treatment.
       :param prognosisCodeableConcept: Estimate of likely outcome.
       :param prognosisReference: RiskAssessment expressing likely outcome.
       :param supportingInfo: Information supporting the clinical impression.
       :param note: Commentary about the impression, typically recorded after the impression
   itself was made, though supplemental notes by the original author could also
   appear.
