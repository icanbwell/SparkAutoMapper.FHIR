   InsurancePlan
   insuranceplan.xsd
       Details of a Health Insurance product/plan provided by an organization.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       Details of a Health Insurance product/plan provided by an organization.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this health insurance product which remain
   constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
       :param status: The current state of the health insurance product.
       :param type_: The kind of health insurance product.
       :param name: Official name of the health insurance product as designated by the owner.
       :param alias: A list of alternate names that the product is known as, or was known as in the
   past.
       :param period: The period of time that the health insurance product is available.
       :param ownedBy: The entity that is providing  the health insurance product and underwriting
   the risk.  This is typically an insurance carriers, other third-party payers,
   or health plan sponsors comonly referred to as 'payers'.
       :param administeredBy: An organization which administer other services such as underwriting, customer
   service and/or claims processing on behalf of the health insurance product
   owner.
       :param coverageArea: The geographic region in which a health insurance product's benefits apply.
       :param contact: The contact for the health insurance product for a certain purpose.
       :param endpoint: The technical endpoints providing access to services operated for the health
   insurance product.
       :param network: Reference to the network included in the health insurance product.
       :param coverage: Details about the coverage offered by the insurance product.
       :param plan: Details about an insurance plan.
