   PractitionerRole
   practitionerrole.xsd
       A specific set of Roles/Locations/specialties/services that a practitioner may
   perform at an organization for a period of time.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       A specific set of Roles/Locations/specialties/services that a practitioner may
   perform at an organization for a period of time.
       If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

       :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
   assigned, this value never changes.
       :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
   infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
   version changes to the resource.
       :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
   constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
   this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
   along with other profiles etc.
       :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
       :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
   used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
   not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
   detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
   Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
   narrative to ensure clinical safety.
       :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
   that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
   have their own independent transaction scope.
       :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
   there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
   extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
   requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
       :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
   definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
   that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
   descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
   make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
   governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
   implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
   that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
   processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

   Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
   or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
   itself).
       :param identifier: Business Identifiers that are specific to a role/location.
       :param active: Whether this practitioner role record is in active use.
       :param period: The period during which the person is authorized to act as a practitioner in
   these role(s) for the organization.
       :param practitioner: Practitioner that is able to provide the defined services for the
   organization.
       :param organization: The organization where the Practitioner performs the roles associated.
       :param code: Roles which this practitioner is authorized to perform for the organization.
       :param specialty: Specific specialty of the practitioner.
       :param location: The location(s) at which this practitioner provides care.
       :param healthcareService: The list of healthcare services that this worker provides for this role's
   Organization/Location(s).
       :param telecom: Contact details that are specific to the role/location/service.
       :param availableTime: A collection of times the practitioner is available or performing this role at
   the location and/or healthcareservice.
       :param notAvailable: The practitioner is not available or performing this role during this period
   of time due to the provided reason.
       :param availabilityExceptions: A description of site availability exceptions, e.g. public holiday
   availability. Succinctly describing all possible exceptions to normal site
   availability as details in the available Times and not available Times.
       :param endpoint: Technical endpoints providing access to services operated for the practitioner
   with this role.
