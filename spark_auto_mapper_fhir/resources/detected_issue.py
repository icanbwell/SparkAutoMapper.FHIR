            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Business identifier associated with the detected issue record.
            :param status: Indicates the status of the detected issue.
            :param code: Identifies the general type of issue identified.
            :param severity: Indicates the degree of importance associated with the identified issue based
        on the potential impact on the patient.
            :param patient: Indicates the patient whose record the detected issue is associated with.
            :param identifiedDateTime: None
            :param identifiedPeriod: None
            :param author: Individual or device responsible for the issue being raised.  For example, a
        decision support application or a pharmacist conducting a medication review.
            :param implicated: Indicates the resource representing the current activity or proposed activity
        that is potentially problematic.
            :param evidence: Supporting evidence or manifestations that provide the basis for identifying
        the detected issue such as a GuidanceResponse or MeasureReport.
            :param detail: A textual explanation of the detected issue.
            :param reference: The literature, knowledge-base or similar reference that describes the
        propensity for the detected issue identified.
            :param mitigation: Indicates an action that has been taken or is committed to reduce or eliminate
        the likelihood of the risk identified by the detected issue from manifesting.
        Can also reflect an observation of known mitigating factors that may
        reduce/eliminate the need for any action.
