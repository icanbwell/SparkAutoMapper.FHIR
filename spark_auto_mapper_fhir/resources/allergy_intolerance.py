            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this AllergyIntolerance by the performer or
        other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates
        from server to server.
            :param clinicalStatus: The clinical status of the allergy or intolerance.
            :param verificationStatus: Assertion about certainty associated with the propensity, or potential risk,
        of a reaction to the identified substance (including pharmaceutical product).
            :param type_: Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for the reaction
        risk.
            :param category: Category of the identified substance.
            :param criticality: Estimate of the potential clinical harm, or seriousness, of the reaction to
        the identified substance.
            :param code: Code for an allergy or intolerance statement (either a positive or a
        negated/excluded statement).  This may be a code for a substance or
        pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse
        reaction risk (e.g., "Latex"), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g.,
        "Latex allergy"), or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class
        (e.g., "No latex allergy") or a general or categorical negated statement
        (e.g.,  "No known allergy", "No known drug allergies").  Note: the substance
        for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the
        cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be
        a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product
        that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only
        process the 'code' and ignore the 'reaction.substance'.  If a receiving system
        is unable to confirm that AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within
        the semantic scope of AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system
        should ignore AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.
            :param patient: The patient who has the allergy or intolerance.
            :param encounter: The encounter when the allergy or intolerance was asserted.
            :param onsetDateTime: None
            :param onsetAge: None
            :param onsetPeriod: None
            :param onsetRange: None
            :param onsetString: None
            :param recordedDate: The recordedDate represents when this particular AllergyIntolerance record was
        created in the system, which is often a system-generated date.
            :param recorder: Individual who recorded the record and takes responsibility for its content.
            :param asserter: The source of the information about the allergy that is recorded.
            :param lastOccurrence: Represents the date and/or time of the last known occurrence of a reaction
        event.
            :param note: Additional narrative about the propensity for the Adverse Reaction, not
        captured in other fields.
            :param reaction: Details about each adverse reaction event linked to exposure to the identified
        substance.
