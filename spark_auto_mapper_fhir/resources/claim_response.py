            This resource provides the adjudication details from the processing of a Claim
        resource.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this claim response.
            :param status: The status of the resource instance.
            :param type_: A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional
        information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
            :param subType: A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional
        information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
            :param use: A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: to request
        adjudication of products and services previously rendered; or requesting
        authorization and adjudication for provision in the future; or requesting the
        non-binding adjudication of the listed products and services which could be
        provided in the future.
            :param patient: The party to whom the professional services and/or products have been supplied
        or are being considered and for whom actual for facast reimbursement is
        sought.
            :param created: The date this resource was created.
            :param insurer: The party responsible for authorization, adjudication and reimbursement.
            :param requestor: The provider which is responsible for the claim, predetermination or
        preauthorization.
            :param request: Original request resource reference.
            :param outcome: The outcome of the claim, predetermination, or preauthorization processing.
            :param disposition: A human readable description of the status of the adjudication.
            :param preAuthRef: Reference from the Insurer which is used in later communications which refers
        to this adjudication.
            :param preAuthPeriod: The time frame during which this authorization is effective.
            :param payeeType: Type of Party to be reimbursed: subscriber, provider, other.
            :param item: A claim line. Either a simple (a product or service) or a 'group' of details
        which can also be a simple items or groups of sub-details.
            :param addItem: The first-tier service adjudications for payor added product or service lines.
            :param adjudication: The adjudication results which are presented at the header level rather than
        at the line-item or add-item levels.
            :param total: Categorized monetary totals for the adjudication.
            :param payment: Payment details for the adjudication of the claim.
            :param fundsReserve: A code, used only on a response to a preauthorization, to indicate whether the
        benefits payable have been reserved and for whom.
            :param formCode: A code for the form to be used for printing the content.
            :param form: The actual form, by reference or inclusion, for printing the content or an
        EOB.
            :param processNote: A note that describes or explains adjudication results in a human readable
        form.
            :param communicationRequest: Request for additional supporting or authorizing information.
            :param insurance: Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and
        services specified on the claim.
            :param error: Errors encountered during the processing of the adjudication.
