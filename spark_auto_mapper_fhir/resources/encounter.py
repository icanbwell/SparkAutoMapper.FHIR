            :param status: planned | arrived | triaged | in-progress | onleave | finished | cancelled +.
            :param statusHistory: The status history permits the encounter resource to contain the status
        history without needing to read through the historical versions of the
        resource, or even have the server store them.
            :param class_: Concepts representing classification of patient encounter such as ambulatory
        (outpatient), inpatient, emergency, home health or others due to local
        variations.
            :param classHistory: The class history permits the tracking of the encounters transitions without
        needing to go  through the resource history.  This would be used for a case
        where an admission starts of as an emergency encounter, then transitions into
        an inpatient scenario. Doing this and not restarting a new encounter ensures
        that any lab/diagnostic results can more easily follow the patient and not
        require re-processing and not get lost or cancelled during a kind of discharge
        from emergency to inpatient.
            :param type_: Specific type of encounter (e.g. e-mail consultation, surgical day-care,
        skilled nursing, rehabilitation).
            :param serviceType: Broad categorization of the service that is to be provided (e.g. cardiology).
            :param priority: Indicates the urgency of the encounter.
            :param subject: The patient or group present at the encounter.
            :param episodeOfCare: Where a specific encounter should be classified as a part of a specific
        episode(s) of care this field should be used. This association can facilitate
        grouping of related encounters together for a specific purpose, such as
        government reporting, issue tracking, association via a common problem.  The
        association is recorded on the encounter as these are typically created after
        the episode of care and grouped on entry rather than editing the episode of
        care to append another encounter to it (the episode of care could span years).
            :param basedOn: The request this encounter satisfies (e.g. incoming referral or procedure
        request).
            :param participant: The list of people responsible for providing the service.
            :param appointment: The appointment that scheduled this encounter.
            :param period: The start and end time of the encounter.
            :param length: Quantity of time the encounter lasted. This excludes the time during leaves of
        absence.
            :param reasonCode: Reason the encounter takes place, expressed as a code. For admissions, this
        can be used for a coded admission diagnosis.
            :param reasonReference: Reason the encounter takes place, expressed as a code. For admissions, this
        can be used for a coded admission diagnosis.
            :param diagnosis: The list of diagnosis relevant to this encounter.
            :param account: The set of accounts that may be used for billing for this Encounter.
            :param hospitalization: Details about the admission to a healthcare service.
            :param location: List of locations where  the patient has been during this encounter.
            :param serviceProvider: The organization that is primarily responsible for this Encounter's services.
        This MAY be the same as the organization on the Patient record, however it
        could be different, such as if the actor performing the services was from an
        external organization (which may be billed seperately) for an external
        consultation.  Refer to the example bundle showing an abbreviated set of
        Encounters for a colonoscopy.

        time).
