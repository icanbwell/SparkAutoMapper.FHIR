            Raw data describing a biological sequence.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: A unique identifier for this particular sequence instance. This is a FHIR-
        defined id.
            :param type_: Amino Acid Sequence/ DNA Sequence / RNA Sequence.
            :param coordinateSystem: Whether the sequence is numbered starting at 0 (0-based numbering or
        coordinates, inclusive start, exclusive end) or starting at 1 (1-based
        numbering, inclusive start and inclusive end).
            :param patient: The patient whose sequencing results are described by this resource.
            :param specimen: Specimen used for sequencing.
            :param device: The method for sequencing, for example, chip information.
            :param performer: The organization or lab that should be responsible for this result.
            :param quantity: The number of copies of the sequence of interest. (RNASeq).
            :param referenceSeq: A sequence that is used as a reference to describe variants that are present
        in a sequence analyzed.
            :param variant: The definition of variant here originates from Sequence ontology ([variant_of]
        (http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/variant_of)). This
        element can represent amino acid or nucleic sequence change(including
        insertion,deletion,SNP,etc.)  It can represent some complex mutation or
        segment variation with the assist of CIGAR string.
            :param observedSeq: Sequence that was observed. It is the result marked by referenceSeq along with
        variant records on referenceSeq. This shall start from
        referenceSeq.windowStart and end by referenceSeq.windowEnd.
            :param quality: An experimental feature attribute that defines the quality of the feature in a
        quantitative way, such as a phred quality score ([SO:0001686](http://www.seque
        nceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001686)).
            :param readCoverage: Coverage (read depth or depth) is the average number of reads representing a
        given nucleotide in the reconstructed sequence.
            :param repository: Configurations of the external repository. The repository shall store target's
        observedSeq or records related with target's observedSeq.
            :param pointer: Pointer to next atomic sequence which at most contains one variant.
            :param structureVariant: Information about chromosome structure variation.
