            A type of a manufactured item that is used in the provision of healthcare
        without being substantially changed through that activity. The device may be a
        medical or non-medical device.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Unique instance identifiers assigned to a device by manufacturers other
        organizations or owners.
            :param definition: The reference to the definition for the device.
            :param udiCarrier: Unique device identifier (UDI) assigned to device label or package.  Note that
        the Device may include multiple udiCarriers as it either may include just the
        udiCarrier for the jurisdiction it is sold, or for multiple jurisdictions it
        could have been sold.
            :param status: Status of the Device availability.
            :param statusReason: Reason for the dtatus of the Device availability.
            :param distinctIdentifier: The distinct identification string as required by regulation for a human cell,
        tissue, or cellular and tissue-based product.
            :param manufacturer: A name of the manufacturer.
            :param manufactureDate: The date and time when the device was manufactured.
            :param expirationDate: The date and time beyond which this device is no longer valid or should not be
        used (if applicable).
            :param lotNumber: Lot number assigned by the manufacturer.
            :param serialNumber: The serial number assigned by the organization when the device was
        manufactured.
            :param deviceName: This represents the manufacturer's name of the device as provided by the
        device, from a UDI label, or by a person describing the Device.  This
        typically would be used when a person provides the name(s) or when the device
        represents one of the names available from DeviceDefinition.
            :param modelNumber: The model number for the device.
            :param partNumber: The part number of the device.
            :param type_: The kind or type of device.
            :param specialization: The capabilities supported on a  device, the standards to which the device
        conforms for a particular purpose, and used for the communication.
            :param version: The actual design of the device or software version running on the device.
            :param property: The actual configuration settings of a device as it actually operates, e.g.,
        regulation status, time properties.
            :param patient: Patient information, If the device is affixed to a person.
            :param owner: An organization that is responsible for the provision and ongoing maintenance
        of the device.
            :param contact: Contact details for an organization or a particular human that is responsible
        for the device.
            :param location: The place where the device can be found.
            :param url: A network address on which the device may be contacted directly.
            :param note: Descriptive information, usage information or implantation information that is
        not captured in an existing element.
            :param safety: Provides additional safety characteristics about a medical device.  For
        example devices containing latex.
            :param parent: The parent device.
