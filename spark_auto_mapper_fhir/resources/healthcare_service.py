            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: External identifiers for this item.
            :param active: This flag is used to mark the record to not be used. This is not used when a
        center is closed for maintenance, or for holidays, the notAvailable period is
        to be used for this.
            :param providedBy: The organization that provides this healthcare service.
            :param category: Identifies the broad category of service being performed or delivered.
            :param type_: The specific type of service that may be delivered or performed.
            :param specialty: Collection of specialties handled by the service site. This is more of a
        medical term.
            :param location: The location(s) where this healthcare service may be provided.
            :param name: Further description of the service as it would be presented to a consumer
        while searching.
            :param comment: Any additional description of the service and/or any specific issues not
        covered by the other attributes, which can be displayed as further detail
        under the serviceName.
            :param extraDetails: Extra details about the service that can't be placed in the other fields.
            :param photo: If there is a photo/symbol associated with this HealthcareService, it may be
        included here to facilitate quick identification of the service in a list.
            :param telecom: List of contacts related to this specific healthcare service.
            :param coverageArea: The location(s) that this service is available to (not where the service is
        provided).
            :param serviceProvisionCode: The code(s) that detail the conditions under which the healthcare service is
        available/offered.
            :param eligibility: Does this service have specific eligibility requirements that need to be met
        in order to use the service?
            :param program: Programs that this service is applicable to.
            :param characteristic: Collection of characteristics (attributes).
            :param communication: Some services are specifically made available in multiple languages, this
        property permits a directory to declare the languages this is offered in.
        Typically this is only provided where a service operates in communities with
        mixed languages used.
            :param referralMethod: Ways that the service accepts referrals, if this is not provided then it is
        implied that no referral is required.
            :param appointmentRequired: Indicates whether or not a prospective consumer will require an appointment
        for a particular service at a site to be provided by the Organization.
        Indicates if an appointment is required for access to this service.
            :param availableTime: A collection of times that the Service Site is available.
            :param notAvailable: The HealthcareService is not available during this period of time due to the
        provided reason.
            :param availabilityExceptions: A description of site availability exceptions, e.g. public holiday
        availability. Succinctly describing all possible exceptions to normal site
        availability as details in the available Times and not available Times.
            :param endpoint: Technical endpoints providing access to services operated for the specific
        healthcare services defined at this resource.
