            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Identifiers assigned to this research study by the sponsor or other systems.
            :param title: A short, descriptive user-friendly label for the study.
            :param protocol: The set of steps expected to be performed as part of the execution of the
        study.
            :param partOf: A larger research study of which this particular study is a component or step.
            :param status: The current state of the study.
            :param primaryPurposeType: The type of study based upon the intent of the study's activities. A
        classification of the intent of the study.
            :param phase: The stage in the progression of a therapy from initial experimental use in
        humans in clinical trials to post-market evaluation.
            :param category: Codes categorizing the type of study such as investigational vs.
        observational, type of blinding, type of randomization, safety vs. efficacy,
        etc.
            :param focus: The medication(s), food(s), therapy(ies), device(s) or other concerns or
        interventions that the study is seeking to gain more information about.
            :param condition: The condition that is the focus of the study.  For example, In a study to
        examine risk factors for Lupus, might have as an inclusion criterion "healthy
        volunteer", but the target condition code would be a Lupus SNOMED code.
            :param contact: Contact details to assist a user in learning more about or engaging with the
        study.
            :param relatedArtifact: Citations, references and other related documents.
            :param keyword: Key terms to aid in searching for or filtering the study.
            :param location: Indicates a country, state or other region where the study is taking place.
            :param description: A full description of how the study is being conducted.
            :param enrollment: Reference to a Group that defines the criteria for and quantity of subjects
        participating in the study.  E.g. " 200 female Europeans between the ages of
        20 and 45 with early onset diabetes".
            :param period: Identifies the start date and the expected (or actual, depending on status)
        end date for the study.
            :param sponsor: An organization that initiates the investigation and is legally responsible
        for the study.
            :param principalInvestigator: A researcher in a study who oversees multiple aspects of the study, such as
        concept development, protocol writing, protocol submission for IRB approval,
        participant recruitment, informed consent, data collection, analysis,
        interpretation and presentation.
            :param site: A facility in which study activities are conducted.
            :param reasonStopped: A description and/or code explaining the premature termination of the study.
            :param note: Comments made about the study by the performer, subject or other participants.
            :param arm: Describes an expected sequence of events for one of the participants of a
        study.  E.g. Exposure to drug A, wash-out, exposure to drug B, wash-out,
        follow-up.
            :param objective: A goal that the study is aiming to achieve in terms of a scientific question
        to be answered by the analysis of data collected during the study.
