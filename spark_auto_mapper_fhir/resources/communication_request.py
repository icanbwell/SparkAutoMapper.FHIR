            A request to convey information; e.g. the CDS system proposes that an alert be
        sent to a responsible provider, the CDS system proposes that the public health
        agency be notified about a reportable condition.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this communication request by the performer
        or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and
        propagates from server to server.
            :param basedOn: A plan or proposal that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this request.
            :param replaces: Completed or terminated request(s) whose function is taken by this new
        request.
            :param groupIdentifier: A shared identifier common to all requests that were authorized more or less
        simultaneously by a single author, representing the identifier of the
        requisition, prescription or similar form.
            :param status: The status of the proposal or order.
            :param statusReason: Captures the reason for the current state of the CommunicationRequest.
            :param category: The type of message to be sent such as alert, notification, reminder,
        instruction, etc.
            :param priority: Characterizes how quickly the proposed act must be initiated. Includes
        concepts such as stat, urgent, routine.
            :param doNotPerform: If true indicates that the CommunicationRequest is asking for the specified
        action to *not* occur.
            :param medium: A channel that was used for this communication (e.g. email, fax).
            :param subject: The patient or group that is the focus of this communication request.
            :param about: Other resources that pertain to this communication request and to which this
        communication request should be associated.
            :param encounter: The Encounter during which this CommunicationRequest was created or to which
        the creation of this record is tightly associated.
            :param payload: Text, attachment(s), or resource(s) to be communicated to the recipient.
            :param occurrenceDateTime: None
            :param occurrencePeriod: None
            :param authoredOn: For draft requests, indicates the date of initial creation.  For requests with
        other statuses, indicates the date of activation.
            :param requester: The device, individual, or organization who initiated the request and has
        responsibility for its activation.
            :param recipient: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, device,
        group, or care team) which is the intended target of the communication.
            :param sender: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, or device)
        which is to be the source of the communication.
            :param reasonCode: Describes why the request is being made in coded or textual form.
            :param reasonReference: Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this request.
            :param note: Comments made about the request by the requester, sender, recipient, subject
        or other participants.
