            The CodeSystem resource is used to declare the existence of and describe a
        code system or code system supplement and its key properties, and optionally
        define a part or all of its content.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this code system when it is
        referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
        canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
        address at which at which an authoritative instance of this code system is (or
        will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It
        SHALL remain the same when the code system is stored on different servers.
        This is used in [Coding](datatypes.html#Coding).system.
            :param identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this code system when it is
        represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
        or an instance.
            :param version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the code system when
        it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an
        arbitrary value managed by the code system author and is not expected to be
        globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a
        managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
        can be placed in a lexicographical sequence. This is used in
        [Coding](datatypes.html#Coding).version.
            :param name: A natural language name identifying the code system. This name should be
        usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
        as code generation.
            :param title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the code system.
            :param status: The date (and optionally time) when the code system resource was created or
        revised.
            :param experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this code system is authored for testing
        purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be used
        for genuine usage.
            :param date: The date  (and optionally time) when the code system was published. The date
        must change when the business version changes and it must change if the status
        code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of
        the code system changes.
            :param publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the code system.
            :param contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
        publisher.
            :param description: A free text natural language description of the code system from a consumer's
        perspective.
            :param useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
        that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
        or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
        may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate code system
        instances.
            :param jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the code system is intended to be used.
            :param purpose: Explanation of why this code system is needed and why it has been designed as
        it has.
            :param copyright: A copyright statement relating to the code system and/or its contents.
        Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
        publishing of the code system.
            :param caseSensitive: If code comparison is case sensitive when codes within this system are
        compared to each other.
            :param valueSet: Canonical reference to the value set that contains the entire code system.
            :param hierarchyMeaning: The meaning of the hierarchy of concepts as represented in this resource.
            :param compositional: The code system defines a compositional (post-coordination) grammar.
            :param versionNeeded: This flag is used to signify that the code system does not commit to concept
        permanence across versions. If true, a version must be specified when
        referencing this code system.
            :param content: The extent of the content of the code system (the concepts and codes it
        defines) are represented in this resource instance.
            :param supplements: The canonical URL of the code system that this code system supplement is
        adding designations and properties to.
            :param count: The total number of concepts defined by the code system. Where the code system
        has a compositional grammar, the basis of this count is defined by the system
        steward.
            :param filter: A filter that can be used in a value set compose statement when selecting
        concepts using a filter.
            :param property: A property defines an additional slot through which additional information can
        be provided about a concept.
            :param concept: Concepts that are in the code system. The concept definitions are inherently
        hierarchical, but the definitions must be consulted to determine what the
        meanings of the hierarchical relationships are.
