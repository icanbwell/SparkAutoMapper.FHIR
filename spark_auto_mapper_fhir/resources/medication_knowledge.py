            Information about a medication that is used to support knowledge.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param code: A code that specifies this medication, or a textual description if no code is
        available. Usage note: This could be a standard medication code such as a code
        from RxNorm, SNOMED CT, IDMP etc. It could also be a national or local
        formulary code, optionally with translations to other code systems.
            :param status: A code to indicate if the medication is in active use.  The status refers to
        the validity about the information of the medication and not to its medicinal
        properties.
            :param manufacturer: Describes the details of the manufacturer of the medication product.  This is
        not intended to represent the distributor of a medication product.
            :param doseForm: Describes the form of the item.  Powder; tablets; capsule.
            :param amount: Specific amount of the drug in the packaged product.  For example, when
        specifying a product that has the same strength (For example, Insulin glargine
        100 unit per mL solution for injection), this attribute provides additional
        clarification of the package amount (For example, 3 mL, 10mL, etc.).
            :param synonym: Additional names for a medication, for example, the name(s) given to a
        medication in different countries.  For example, acetaminophen and paracetamol
        or salbutamol and albuterol.
            :param relatedMedicationKnowledge: Associated or related knowledge about a medication.
            :param associatedMedication: Associated or related medications.  For example, if the medication is a
        branded product (e.g. Crestor), this is the Therapeutic Moeity (e.g.
        Rosuvastatin) or if this is a generic medication (e.g. Rosuvastatin), this
        would link to a branded product (e.g. Crestor).
            :param productType: Category of the medication or product (e.g. branded product, therapeutic
        moeity, generic product, innovator product, etc.).
            :param monograph: Associated documentation about the medication.
            :param ingredient: Identifies a particular constituent of interest in the product.
            :param preparationInstruction: The instructions for preparing the medication.
            :param intendedRoute: The intended or approved route of administration.
            :param cost: The price of the medication.
            :param monitoringProgram: The program under which the medication is reviewed.
            :param administrationGuidelines: Guidelines for the administration of the medication.
            :param medicineClassification: Categorization of the medication within a formulary or classification system.
            :param packaging: Information that only applies to packages (not products).
            :param drugCharacteristic: Specifies descriptive properties of the medicine, such as color, shape,
        imprints, etc.
            :param contraindication: Potential clinical issue with or between medication(s) (for example, drug-drug
        interaction, drug-disease contraindication, drug-allergy interaction, etc.).
            :param regulatory: Regulatory information about a medication.
            :param kinetics: The time course of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of
        a medication from the body.
