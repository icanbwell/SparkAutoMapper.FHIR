            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Business identifier for the marketing authorization, as assigned by a
        regulator.
            :param subject: The medicinal product that is being authorized.
            :param country: The country in which the marketing authorization has been granted.
            :param jurisdiction: Jurisdiction within a country.
            :param status: The status of the marketing authorization.
            :param statusDate: The date at which the given status has become applicable.
            :param restoreDate: The date when a suspended the marketing or the marketing authorization of the
        product is anticipated to be restored.
            :param validityPeriod: The beginning of the time period in which the marketing authorization is in
        the specific status shall be specified A complete date consisting of day,
        month and year shall be specified using the ISO 8601 date format.
            :param dataExclusivityPeriod: A period of time after authorization before generic product applicatiosn can
        be submitted.
            :param dateOfFirstAuthorization: The date when the first authorization was granted by a Medicines Regulatory
        Agency.
            :param internationalBirthDate: Date of first marketing authorization for a company's new medicinal product in
        any country in the World.
            :param legalBasis: The legal framework against which this authorization is granted.
            :param jurisdictionalAuthorization: Authorization in areas within a country.
            :param holder: Marketing Authorization Holder.
