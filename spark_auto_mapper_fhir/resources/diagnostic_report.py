            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Identifiers assigned to this report by the performer or other systems.
            :param basedOn: Details concerning a service requested.
            :param status: The status of the diagnostic report.
            :param category: A code that classifies the clinical discipline, department or diagnostic
        service that created the report (e.g. cardiology, biochemistry, hematology,
        MRI). This is used for searching, sorting and display purposes.
            :param code: A code or name that describes this diagnostic report.
            :param subject: The subject of the report. Usually, but not always, this is a patient.
        However, diagnostic services also perform analyses on specimens collected from
        a variety of other sources.
            :param encounter: The healthcare event  (e.g. a patient and healthcare provider interaction)
        which this DiagnosticReport is about.
            :param effectiveDateTime: None
            :param effectivePeriod: None
            :param issued: The date and time that this version of the report was made available to
        providers, typically after the report was reviewed and verified.
            :param performer: The diagnostic service that is responsible for issuing the report.
            :param resultsInterpreter: The practitioner or organization that is responsible for the report's
        conclusions and interpretations.
            :param specimen: Details about the specimens on which this diagnostic report is based.
            :param result: [Observations](observation.html)  that are part of this diagnostic report.
            :param imagingStudy: One or more links to full details of any imaging performed during the
        diagnostic investigation. Typically, this is imaging performed by DICOM
        enabled modalities, but this is not required. A fully enabled PACS viewer can
        use this information to provide views of the source images.
            :param media: A list of key images associated with this report. The images are generally
        created during the diagnostic process, and may be directly of the patient, or
        of treated specimens (i.e. slides of interest).
            :param conclusion: Concise and clinically contextualized summary conclusion
        (interpretation/impression) of the diagnostic report.
            :param conclusionCode: One or more codes that represent the summary conclusion
        (interpretation/impression) of the diagnostic report.
            :param presentedForm: Rich text representation of the entire result as issued by the diagnostic
        service. Multiple formats are allowed but they SHALL be semantically
        equivalent.
