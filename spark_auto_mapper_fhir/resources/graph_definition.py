            A formal computable definition of a graph of resources - that is, a coherent
        set of resources that form a graph by following references. The Graph
        Definition resource defines a set and makes rules about the set.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this graph definition when it is
        referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
        canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
        address at which at which an authoritative instance of this graph definition
        is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical
        reference. It SHALL remain the same when the graph definition is stored on
        different servers.
            :param version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the graph definition
        when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
        an arbitrary value managed by the graph definition author and is not expected
        to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if
        a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
        can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
            :param name: A natural language name identifying the graph definition. This name should be
        usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
        as code generation.
            :param status: The status of this graph definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
        content.
            :param experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this graph definition is authored for testing
        purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be used
        for genuine usage.
            :param date: The date  (and optionally time) when the graph definition was published. The
        date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the
        status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
        content of the graph definition changes.
            :param publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the graph
        definition.
            :param contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
        publisher.
            :param description: A free text natural language description of the graph definition from a
        consumer's perspective.
            :param useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
        that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
        or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
        may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate graph
        definition instances.
            :param jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the graph definition is intended to be
        used.
            :param purpose: Explanation of why this graph definition is needed and why it has been
        designed as it has.
            :param start: The type of FHIR resource at which instances of this graph start.
            :param profile: The profile that describes the use of the base resource.
            :param link: Links this graph makes rules about.
