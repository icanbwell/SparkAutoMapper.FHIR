            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Unique identifier for this copy of the Consent Statement.
            :param status: Indicates the current state of this consent.
            :param scope: A selector of the type of consent being presented: ADR, Privacy, Treatment,
        Research.  This list is now extensible.
            :param category: A classification of the type of consents found in the statement. This element
        supports indexing and retrieval of consent statements.
            :param patient: The patient/healthcare consumer to whom this consent applies.
            :param dateTime: When this  Consent was issued / created / indexed.
            :param performer: Either the Grantor, which is the entity responsible for granting the rights
        listed in a Consent Directive or the Grantee, which is the entity responsible
        for complying with the Consent Directive, including any obligations or
        limitations on authorizations and enforcement of prohibitions.
            :param organization: The organization that manages the consent, and the framework within which it
        is executed.
            :param sourceAttachment: None
            :param sourceReference: None
            :param policy: The references to the policies that are included in this consent scope.
        Policies may be organizational, but are often defined jurisdictionally, or in
        law.
            :param policyRule: A reference to the specific base computable regulation or policy.
            :param verification: Whether a treatment instruction (e.g. artificial respiration yes or no) was
        verified with the patient, his/her family or another authorized person.
            :param provision: An exception to the base policy of this consent. An exception can be an
        addition or removal of access permissions.
