            The EffectEvidenceSynthesis resource describes the difference in an outcome
        between exposures states in a population where the effect estimate is derived
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this effect evidence synthesis when
        it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called
        its canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a
        literal address at which at which an authoritative instance of this effect
        evidence synthesis is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
        canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the effect evidence
        synthesis is stored on different servers.
            :param identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this effect evidence synthesis
        when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification,
        model, design or an instance.
            :param version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the effect evidence
        synthesis when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance.
        This is an arbitrary value managed by the effect evidence synthesis author and
        is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp
        (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no
        expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
            :param name: A natural language name identifying the effect evidence synthesis. This name
        should be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing
        applications such as code generation.
            :param title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the effect evidence synthesis.
            :param status: The status of this effect evidence synthesis. Enables tracking the life-cycle
        of the content.
            :param date: The date  (and optionally time) when the effect evidence synthesis was
        published. The date must change when the business version changes and it must
        change if the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the
        substantive content of the effect evidence synthesis changes.
            :param publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the effect evidence
        synthesis.
            :param contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
        publisher.
            :param description: A free text natural language description of the effect evidence synthesis from
        a consumer's perspective.
            :param note: A human-readable string to clarify or explain concepts about the resource.
            :param useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
        that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
        or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
        may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate effect
        evidence synthesis instances.
            :param jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the effect evidence synthesis is
        intended to be used.
            :param copyright: A copyright statement relating to the effect evidence synthesis and/or its
        contents. Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
        publishing of the effect evidence synthesis.
            :param approvalDate: The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval
        happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.
            :param lastReviewDate: The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens
        periodically after approval but does not change the original approval date.
            :param effectivePeriod: The period during which the effect evidence synthesis content was or is
        planned to be in active use.
            :param topic: Descriptive topics related to the content of the EffectEvidenceSynthesis.
        Topics provide a high-level categorization grouping types of
        EffectEvidenceSynthesiss that can be useful for filtering and searching.
            :param author: An individiual or organization primarily involved in the creation and
        maintenance of the content.
            :param editor: An individual or organization primarily responsible for internal coherence of
        the content.
            :param reviewer: An individual or organization primarily responsible for review of some aspect
        of the content.
            :param endorser: An individual or organization responsible for officially endorsing the content
        for use in some setting.
            :param relatedArtifact: Related artifacts such as additional documentation, justification, or
        bibliographic references.
            :param synthesisType: Type of synthesis eg meta-analysis.
            :param studyType: Type of study eg randomized trial.
            :param population: A reference to a EvidenceVariable resource that defines the population for the
        research.
            :param exposure: A reference to a EvidenceVariable resource that defines the exposure for the
        research.
            :param exposureAlternative: A reference to a EvidenceVariable resource that defines the comparison
        exposure for the research.
            :param outcome: A reference to a EvidenceVariable resomece that defines the outcome for the
        research.
            :param sampleSize: A description of the size of the sample involved in the synthesis.
            :param resultsByExposure: A description of the results for each exposure considered in the effect
        estimate.
