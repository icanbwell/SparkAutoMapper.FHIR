            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: A version-independent identifier for the Composition. This identifier stays
        constant as the composition is changed over time.
            :param status: The workflow/clinical status of this composition. The status is a marker for
        the clinical standing of the document.
            :param type_: Specifies the particular kind of composition (e.g. History and Physical,
        Discharge Summary, Progress Note). This usually equates to the purpose of
        making the composition.
            :param category: A categorization for the type of the composition - helps for indexing and
        searching. This may be implied by or derived from the code specified in the
        Composition Type.
            :param subject: Who or what the composition is about. The composition can be about a person,
        (patient or healthcare practitioner), a device (e.g. a machine) or even a
        group of subjects (such as a document about a herd of livestock, or a set of
        patients that share a common exposure).
            :param encounter: Describes the clinical encounter or type of care this documentation is
        associated with.
            :param date: The composition editing time, when the composition was last logically changed
        by the author.
            :param author: Identifies who is responsible for the information in the composition, not
        necessarily who typed it in.
            :param title: Official human-readable label for the composition.
            :param confidentiality: The code specifying the level of confidentiality of the Composition.
            :param attester: A participant who has attested to the accuracy of the composition/document.
            :param custodian: Identifies the organization or group who is responsible for ongoing
        maintenance of and access to the composition/document information.
            :param relatesTo: Relationships that this composition has with other compositions or documents
        that already exist.
            :param event: The clinical service, such as a colonoscopy or an appendectomy, being
        documented.
            :param section: The root of the sections that make up the composition.
