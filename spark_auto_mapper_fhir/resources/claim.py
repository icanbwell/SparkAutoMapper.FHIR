            A provider issued list of professional services and products which have been
        provided, or are to be provided, to a patient which is sent to an insurer for
        reimbursement.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this claim.
            :param status: The status of the resource instance.
            :param type_: The category of claim, e.g. oral, pharmacy, vision, institutional,
        professional.
            :param subType: A finer grained suite of claim type codes which may convey additional
        information such as Inpatient vs Outpatient and/or a specialty service.
            :param use: A code to indicate whether the nature of the request is: to request
        adjudication of products and services previously rendered; or requesting
        authorization and adjudication for provision in the future; or requesting the
        non-binding adjudication of the listed products and services which could be
        provided in the future.
            :param patient: The party to whom the professional services and/or products have been supplied
        or are being considered and for whom actual or forecast reimbursement is
        sought.
            :param billablePeriod: The period for which charges are being submitted.
            :param created: The date this resource was created.
            :param enterer: Individual who created the claim, predetermination or preauthorization.
            :param insurer: The Insurer who is target of the request.
            :param provider: The provider which is responsible for the claim, predetermination or
        preauthorization.
            :param priority: The provider-required urgency of processing the request. Typical values
        include: stat, routine deferred.
            :param fundsReserve: A code to indicate whether and for whom funds are to be reserved for future
        claims.
            :param related: Other claims which are related to this claim such as prior submissions or
        claims for related services or for the same event.
            :param prescription: Prescription to support the dispensing of pharmacy, device or vision products.
            :param originalPrescription: Original prescription which has been superseded by this prescription to
        support the dispensing of pharmacy services, medications or products.
            :param payee: The party to be reimbursed for cost of the products and services according to
        the terms of the policy.
            :param referral: A reference to a referral resource.
            :param facility: Facility where the services were provided.
            :param careTeam: The members of the team who provided the products and services.
            :param supportingInfo: Additional information codes regarding exceptions, special considerations, the
        condition, situation, prior or concurrent issues.
            :param diagnosis: Information about diagnoses relevant to the claim items.
            :param procedure: Procedures performed on the patient relevant to the billing items with the
        claim.
            :param insurance: Financial instruments for reimbursement for the health care products and
        services specified on the claim.
            :param accident: Details of an accident which resulted in injuries which required the products
        and services listed in the claim.
            :param item: A claim line. Either a simple  product or service or a 'group' of details
        which can each be a simple items or groups of sub-details.
            :param total: The total value of the all the items in the claim.
