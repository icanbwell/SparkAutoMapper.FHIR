            The MeasureReport resource contains the results of the calculation of a
        measure; and optionally a reference to the resources involved in that
        calculation.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this MeasureReport when it is
        represented in other formats or referenced in a specification, model, design
        or an instance.
            :param status: The MeasureReport status. No data will be available until the MeasureReport
        status is complete.
            :param type_: The type of measure report. This may be an individual report, which provides
        the score for the measure for an individual member of the population; a
        subject-listing, which returns the list of members that meet the various
        criteria in the measure; a summary report, which returns a population count
        for each of the criteria in the measure; or a data-collection, which enables
        the MeasureReport to be used to exchange the data-of-interest for a quality
        measure.
            :param measure: A reference to the Measure that was calculated to produce this report.
            :param subject: Optional subject identifying the individual or individuals the report is for.
            :param date: The date this measure report was generated.
            :param reporter: The individual, location, or organization that is reporting the data.
            :param period: The reporting period for which the report was calculated.
            :param improvementNotation: Whether improvement in the measure is noted by an increase or decrease in the
        measure score.
            :param group: The results of the calculation, one for each population group in the measure.
            :param evaluatedResource: A reference to a Bundle containing the Resources that were used in the
        calculation of this measure.
