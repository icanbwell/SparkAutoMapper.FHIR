            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Identifiers assigned to this event performer or other systems.
            :param definitionUri: References the (external) source of pricing information, rules of application
        for the code this ChargeItem uses.
            :param definitionCanonical: References the source of pricing information, rules of application for the
        code this ChargeItem uses.
            :param status: The current state of the ChargeItem.
            :param partOf: ChargeItems can be grouped to larger ChargeItems covering the whole set.
            :param code: A code that identifies the charge, like a billing code.
            :param subject: The individual or set of individuals the action is being or was performed on.
            :param context: The encounter or episode of care that establishes the context for this event.

            :param occurrencePeriod: None
            :param occurrenceTiming: None
            :param performer: Indicates who or what performed or participated in the charged service.
            :param performingOrganization: The organization requesting the service.
            :param requestingOrganization: The organization performing the service.
            :param costCenter: The financial cost center permits the tracking of charge attribution.
            :param quantity: Quantity of which the charge item has been serviced.
            :param bodysite: The anatomical location where the related service has been applied.
            :param factorOverride: Factor overriding the factor determined by the rules associated with the code.
            :param priceOverride: Total price of the charge overriding the list price associated with the code.
            :param overrideReason: If the list price or the rule-based factor associated with the code is
        overridden, this attribute can capture a text to indicate the  reason for this
        action.
            :param enterer: The device, practitioner, etc. who entered the charge item.
            :param enteredDate: Date the charge item was entered.
