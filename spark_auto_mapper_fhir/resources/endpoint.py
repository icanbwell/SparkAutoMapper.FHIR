        server. This may include any security context information.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Identifier for the organization that is used to identify the endpoint across
        multiple disparate systems.
            :param status: active | suspended | error | off | test.
            :param connectionType: A coded value that represents the technical details of the usage of this
        endpoint, such as what WSDLs should be used in what way. (e.g.
        XDS.b/DICOM/cds-hook).
            :param name: A friendly name that this endpoint can be referred to with.
            :param managingOrganization: The organization that manages this endpoint (even if technically another
        organization is hosting this in the cloud, it is the organization associated
        with the data).
            :param contact: Contact details for a human to contact about the subscription. The primary use
        of this for system administrator troubleshooting.
            :param period: The interval during which the endpoint is expected to be operational.
            :param payloadType: The payload type describes the acceptable content that can be communicated on
        the endpoint.
            :param payloadMimeType: The mime type to send the payload in - e.g. application/fhir+xml,
        application/fhir+json. If the mime type is not specified, then the sender
        could send any content (including no content depending on the connectionType).
            :param address: The uri that describes the actual end-point to connect to.
            :param header: Additional headers / information to send as part of the notification.
