            A ValueSet resource instance specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more
        code systems, intended for use in a particular context. Value sets link
        between [[[CodeSystem]]] definitions and their use in [coded
        elements](terminologies.html).
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this value set when it is referenced
        in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its canonical
        identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal address at
        which at which an authoritative instance of this value set is (or will be)
        published. This URL can be the target of a canonical reference. It SHALL
        remain the same when the value set is stored on different servers.
            :param identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this value set when it is
        represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
        or an instance.
            :param version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the value set when it
        is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is an
        arbitrary value managed by the value set author and is not expected to be
        globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a
        managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
        can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
            :param name: A natural language name identifying the value set. This name should be usable
        as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such as
        code generation.
            :param title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the value set.
            :param status: The status of this value set. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the content.
        The status of the value set applies to the value set definition
        (ValueSet.compose) and the associated ValueSet metadata. Expansions do not
        have a state.
            :param experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this value set is authored for testing
        purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be used
        for genuine usage.
            :param date: The date (and optionally time) when the value set was created or revised (e.g.
        the 'content logical definition').
            :param publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the value set.
            :param contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
        publisher.
            :param description: A free text natural language description of the value set from a consumer's
        perspective. The textual description specifies the span of meanings for
        concepts to be included within the Value Set Expansion, and also may specify
        the intended use and limitations of the Value Set.
            :param useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
        that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
        or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
        may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate value set
        instances.
            :param jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the value set is intended to be used.
            :param immutable: If this is set to 'true', then no new versions of the content logical
        definition can be created.  Note: Other metadata might still change.
            :param purpose: Explanation of why this value set is needed and why it has been designed as it
        has.
            :param copyright: A copyright statement relating to the value set and/or its contents. Copyright
        statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and publishing of the
        value set.
            :param compose: A set of criteria that define the contents of the value set by including or
        excluding codes selected from the specified code system(s) that the value set
        draws from. This is also known as the Content Logical Definition (CLD).
            :param expansion: A value set can also be "expanded", where the value set is turned into a
        simple collection of enumerated codes. This element holds the expansion, if it
        has been performed.
