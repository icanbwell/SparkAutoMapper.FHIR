            An action that is or was performed on or for a patient. This can be a physical
        intervention like an operation, or less invasive like long term services,
        counseling, or hypnotherapy.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this procedure by the performer or other
        systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and is propagated
        from server to server.
            :param instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, order set or other
        definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Procedure.
            :param instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, order set or
        other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Procedure.
            :param basedOn: A reference to a resource that contains details of the request for this
        procedure.
            :param partOf: A larger event of which this particular procedure is a component or step.
            :param status: A code specifying the state of the procedure. Generally, this will be the in-
        progress or completed state.
            :param statusReason: Captures the reason for the current state of the procedure.
            :param category: A code that classifies the procedure for searching, sorting and display
        purposes (e.g. "Surgical Procedure").
            :param code: The specific procedure that is performed. Use text if the exact nature of the
        procedure cannot be coded (e.g. "Laparoscopic Appendectomy").
            :param subject: The person, animal or group on which the procedure was performed.
            :param encounter: The Encounter during which this Procedure was created or performed or to which
        the creation of this record is tightly associated.
            :param performedDateTime: None
            :param performedPeriod: None
            :param performedString: None
            :param performedAge: None
            :param performedRange: None
            :param recorder: Individual who recorded the record and takes responsibility for its content.
            :param asserter: Individual who is making the procedure statement.
            :param performer: Limited to "real" people rather than equipment.
            :param location: The location where the procedure actually happened.  E.g. a newborn at home, a
        tracheostomy at a restaurant.
            :param reasonCode: The coded reason why the procedure was performed. This may be a coded entity
        of some type, or may simply be present as text.
            :param reasonReference: The justification of why the procedure was performed.
            :param bodySite: Detailed and structured anatomical location information. Multiple locations
        are allowed - e.g. multiple punch biopsies of a lesion.
            :param outcome: The outcome of the procedure - did it resolve the reasons for the procedure
        being performed?
            :param report: This could be a histology result, pathology report, surgical report, etc.
            :param complication: Any complications that occurred during the procedure, or in the immediate
        post-performance period. These are generally tracked separately from the
        notes, which will typically describe the procedure itself rather than any
        'post procedure' issues.
            :param complicationDetail: Any complications that occurred during the procedure, or in the immediate
        post-performance period.
            :param followUp: If the procedure required specific follow up - e.g. removal of sutures. The
        follow up may be represented as a simple note or could potentially be more
        complex, in which case the CarePlan resource can be used.
            :param note: Any other notes and comments about the procedure.
            :param focalDevice: A device that is implanted, removed or otherwise manipulated (calibration,
        battery replacement, fitting a prosthesis, attaching a wound-vac, etc.) as a
        focal portion of the Procedure.
            :param usedReference: Identifies medications, devices and any other substance used as part of the
        procedure.
            :param usedCode: Identifies coded items that were used as part of the procedure.
