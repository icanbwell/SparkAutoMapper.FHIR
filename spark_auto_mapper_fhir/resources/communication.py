            An occurrence of information being transmitted; e.g. an alert that was sent to
        a responsible provider, a public health agency that was notified about a
        reportable condition.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this communication by the performer or other
        systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from
        server to server.
            :param instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other
        definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Communication.
            :param instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, orderset or
        other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Communication.
            :param basedOn: An order, proposal or plan fulfilled in whole or in part by this
        Communication.
            :param partOf: Part of this action.
            :param inResponseTo: Prior communication that this communication is in response to.
            :param status: The status of the transmission.
            :param statusReason: Captures the reason for the current state of the Communication.
            :param category: The type of message conveyed such as alert, notification, reminder,
        instruction, etc.
            :param priority: Characterizes how quickly the planned or in progress communication must be
        addressed. Includes concepts such as stat, urgent, routine.
            :param medium: A channel that was used for this communication (e.g. email, fax).
            :param subject: The patient or group that was the focus of this communication.
            :param topic: Description of the purpose/content, similar to a subject line in an email.
            :param about: Other resources that pertain to this communication and to which this
        communication should be associated.
            :param encounter: The Encounter during which this Communication was created or to which the
        creation of this record is tightly associated.
            :param sent: The time when this communication was sent.
            :param received: The time when this communication arrived at the destination.
            :param recipient: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, care team
        or device) which was the target of the communication. If receipts need to be
        tracked by an individual, a separate resource instance will need to be created
        for each recipient.  Multiple recipient communications are intended where
        either receipts are not tracked (e.g. a mass mail-out) or a receipt is
        captured in aggregate (all emails confirmed received by a particular time).
            :param sender: The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, or device)
        which was the source of the communication.
            :param reasonCode: The reason or justification for the communication.
            :param reasonReference: Indicates another resource whose existence justifies this communication.
            :param payload: Text, attachment(s), or resource(s) that was communicated to the recipient.
            :param note: Additional notes or commentary about the communication by the sender, receiver
        or other interested parties.
