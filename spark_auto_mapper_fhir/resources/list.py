            A list is a curated collection of resources.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Identifier for the List assigned for business purposes outside the context of
        FHIR.
            :param status: Indicates the current state of this list.
            :param mode: How this list was prepared - whether it is a working list that is suitable for
        being maintained on an ongoing basis, or if it represents a snapshot of a list
        of items from another source, or whether it is a prepared list where items may
        be marked as added, modified or deleted.
            :param title: A label for the list assigned by the author.
            :param code: This code defines the purpose of the list - why it was created.
            :param subject: The common subject (or patient) of the resources that are in the list if there
        is one.
            :param encounter: The encounter that is the context in which this list was created.
            :param date: The date that the list was prepared.
            :param source: The entity responsible for deciding what the contents of the list were. Where
        the list was created by a human, this is the same as the author of the list.
            :param orderedBy: What order applies to the items in the list.
            :param note: Comments that apply to the overall list.
            :param entry: Entries in this list.
            :param emptyReason: If the list is empty, why the list is empty.
