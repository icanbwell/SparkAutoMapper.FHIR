            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: A unique identifier assigned to this immunization record.
            :param status: Indicates the current status of the immunization event.
            :param statusReason: Indicates the reason the immunization event was not performed.
            :param vaccineCode: Vaccine that was administered or was to be administered.
            :param patient: The patient who either received or did not receive the immunization.
            :param encounter: The visit or admission or other contact between patient and health care
        provider the immunization was performed as part of.
            :param occurrenceDateTime: None
            :param occurrenceString: None
            :param recorded: The date the occurrence of the immunization was first captured in the record -
        potentially significantly after the occurrence of the event.
            :param primarySource: An indication that the content of the record is based on information from the
        person who administered the vaccine. This reflects the context under which the
        data was originally recorded.
            :param reportOrigin: The source of the data when the report of the immunization event is not based
        on information from the person who administered the vaccine.
            :param location: The service delivery location where the vaccine administration occurred.
            :param manufacturer: Name of vaccine manufacturer.
            :param lotNumber: Lot number of the  vaccine product.
            :param expirationDate: Date vaccine batch expires.
            :param site: Body site where vaccine was administered.
            :param route: The path by which the vaccine product is taken into the body.
            :param doseQuantity: The quantity of vaccine product that was administered.
            :param performer: Indicates who performed the immunization event.
            :param note: Extra information about the immunization that is not conveyed by the other
        attributes.
            :param reasonCode: Reasons why the vaccine was administered.
            :param reasonReference: Condition, Observation or DiagnosticReport that supports why the immunization
        was administered.
            :param isSubpotent: Indication if a dose is considered to be subpotent. By default, a dose should
        be considered to be potent.
            :param subpotentReason: Reason why a dose is considered to be subpotent.
            :param education: Educational material presented to the patient (or guardian) at the time of
        vaccine administration.
            :param programEligibility: Indicates a patient's eligibility for a funding program.
            :param fundingSource: Indicates the source of the vaccine actually administered. This may be
        different than the patient eligibility (e.g. the patient may be eligible for a
        publically purchased vaccine but due to inventory issues, vaccine purchased
        with private funds was actually administered).
            :param reaction: Categorical data indicating that an adverse event is associated in time to an
        immunization.
            :param protocolApplied: The protocol (set of recommendations) being followed by the provider who
        administered the dose.
