            A request to supply a diet, formula feeding (enteral) or oral nutritional
        supplement to a patient/resident.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Identifiers assigned to this order by the order sender or by the order
        receiver.
            :param instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other
        definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this NutritionOrder.
            :param instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, orderset or
        other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this
        NutritionOrder.
            :param instantiates: The URL pointing to a protocol, guideline, orderset or other definition that
        is adhered to in whole or in part by this NutritionOrder.
            :param status: The workflow status of the nutrition order/request.
            :param intent: Indicates the level of authority/intentionality associated with the
        NutrionOrder and where the request fits into the workflow chain.
            :param patient: The person (patient) who needs the nutrition order for an oral diet,
        nutritional supplement and/or enteral or formula feeding.
            :param encounter: An encounter that provides additional information about the healthcare context
        in which this request is made.
            :param dateTime: The date and time that this nutrition order was requested.
            :param orderer: The practitioner that holds legal responsibility for ordering the diet,
        nutritional supplement, or formula feedings.
            :param allergyIntolerance: A link to a record of allergies or intolerances  which should be included in
        the nutrition order.
            :param foodPreferenceModifier: This modifier is used to convey order-specific modifiers about the type of
        food that should be given. These can be derived from patient allergies,
        intolerances, or preferences such as Halal, Vegan or Kosher. This modifier
        applies to the entire nutrition order inclusive of the oral diet, nutritional
        supplements and enteral formula feedings.
            :param excludeFoodModifier: This modifier is used to convey Order-specific modifier about the type of oral
        food or oral fluids that should not be given. These can be derived from
        patient allergies, intolerances, or preferences such as No Red Meat, No Soy or
        No Wheat or  Gluten-Free.  While it should not be necessary to repeat allergy
        or intolerance information captured in the referenced AllergyIntolerance
        resource in the excludeFoodModifier, this element may be used to convey
        additional specificity related to foods that should be eliminated from the
        patient’s diet for any reason.  This modifier applies to the entire nutrition
        order inclusive of the oral diet, nutritional supplements and enteral formula
        feedings.
            :param oralDiet: Diet given orally in contrast to enteral (tube) feeding.
            :param supplement: Oral nutritional products given in order to add further nutritional value to
        the patient's diet.
            :param enteralFormula: Feeding provided through the gastrointestinal tract via a tube, catheter, or
        stoma that delivers nutrition distal to the oral cavity.
            :param note: Comments made about the {{title}} by the requester, performer, subject or
        other participants.
