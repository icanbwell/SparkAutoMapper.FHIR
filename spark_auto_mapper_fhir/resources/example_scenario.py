            Example of workflow instance.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this example scenario when it is
        referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
        canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
        address at which at which an authoritative instance of this example scenario
        is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a canonical
        reference. It SHALL remain the same when the example scenario is stored on
        different servers.
            :param identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this example scenario when it is
        represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design
        or an instance.
            :param version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the example scenario
        when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
        an arbitrary value managed by the example scenario author and is not expected
        to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if
        a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation that versions
        can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
            :param name: A natural language name identifying the example scenario. This name should be
        usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications such
        as code generation.
            :param status: The status of this example scenario. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
        content.
            :param experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this example scenario is authored for testing
        purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be used
        for genuine usage.
            :param date: The date  (and optionally time) when the example scenario was published. The
        date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the
        status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
        content of the example scenario changes. (e.g. the 'content logical
        definition').
            :param publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the example
        scenario.
            :param contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
        publisher.
            :param useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
        that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
        or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
        may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate example
        scenario instances.
            :param jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the example scenario is intended to be
        used.
            :param copyright: A copyright statement relating to the example scenario and/or its contents.
        Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
        publishing of the example scenario.
            :param purpose: What the example scenario resource is created for. This should not be used to
        show the business purpose of the scenario itself, but the purpose of
        documenting a scenario.
            :param actor: Actor participating in the resource.
            :param instance: Each resource and each version that is present in the workflow.
            :param process: Each major process - a group of operations.
            :param workflow: Another nested workflow.
