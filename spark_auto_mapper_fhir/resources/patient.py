            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: An identifier for this patient.
            :param active: Whether this patient record is in active use.
        Many systems use this property to mark as non-current patients, such as those
        that have not been seen for a period of time based on an organization's
        business rules.

        It is often used to filter patient lists to exclude inactive patients

        Deceased patients may also be marked as inactive for the same reasons, but may
        be active for some time after death.
            :param name: A name associated with the individual.
            :param telecom: A contact detail (e.g. a telephone number or an email address) by which the
        individual may be contacted.
            :param gender: Administrative Gender - the gender that the patient is considered to have for
        administration and record keeping purposes.
            :param birthDate: The date of birth for the individual.
            :param deceasedBoolean: None
            :param deceasedDateTime: None
            :param address: An address for the individual.
            :param maritalStatus: This field contains a patient's most recent marital (civil) status.
            :param multipleBirthBoolean: None
            :param multipleBirthInteger: None
            :param photo: Image of the patient.
            :param contact: A contact party (e.g. guardian, partner, friend) for the patient.
            :param communication: A language which may be used to communicate with the patient about his or her
        health.
            :param generalPractitioner: Patient's nominated care provider.
            :param managingOrganization: Organization that is the custodian of the patient record.
            :param link: Link to another patient resource that concerns the same actual patient.
