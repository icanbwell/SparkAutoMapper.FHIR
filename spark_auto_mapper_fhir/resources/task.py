            A task to be performed.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: The business identifier for this task.
            :param instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a *FHIR*-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other
        definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Task.
            :param instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an *externally* maintained  protocol, guideline, orderset
        or other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this Task.
            :param basedOn: BasedOn refers to a higher-level authorization that triggered the creation of
        the task.  It references a "request" resource such as a ServiceRequest,
        MedicationRequest, ServiceRequest, CarePlan, etc. which is distinct from the
        "request" resource the task is seeking to fulfill.  This latter resource is
        referenced by FocusOn.  For example, based on a ServiceRequest (= BasedOn), a
        task is created to fulfill a procedureRequest ( = FocusOn ) to collect a
        specimen from a patient.
            :param groupIdentifier: An identifier that links together multiple tasks and other requests that were
        created in the same context.
            :param partOf: Task that this particular task is part of.
            :param status: The current status of the task.
            :param statusReason: An explanation as to why this task is held, failed, was refused, etc.
            :param businessStatus: Contains business-specific nuances of the business state.
            :param intent: Indicates the "level" of actionability associated with the Task, i.e. i+R[9]Cs
        this a proposed task, a planned task, an actionable task, etc.
            :param priority: Indicates how quickly the Task should be addressed with respect to other
        requests.
            :param code: A name or code (or both) briefly describing what the task involves.
            :param description: A free-text description of what is to be performed.
            :param focus: The request being actioned or the resource being manipulated by this task.
            :param for_: The entity who benefits from the performance of the service specified in the
        task (e.g., the patient).
            :param encounter: The healthcare event  (e.g. a patient and healthcare provider interaction)
        during which this task was created.
            :param executionPeriod: Identifies the time action was first taken against the task (start) and/or the
        time final action was taken against the task prior to marking it as completed
        (end).
            :param authoredOn: The date and time this task was created.
            :param lastModified: The date and time of last modification to this task.
            :param requester: The creator of the task.
            :param performerType: The kind of participant that should perform the task.
            :param owner: Individual organization or Device currently responsible for task execution.
            :param location: Principal physical location where the this task is performed.
            :param reasonCode: A description or code indicating why this task needs to be performed.
            :param reasonReference: A resource reference indicating why this task needs to be performed.
            :param insurance: Insurance plans, coverage extensions, pre-authorizations and/or pre-
        determinations that may be relevant to the Task.
            :param note: Free-text information captured about the task as it progresses.
            :param relevantHistory: Links to Provenance records for past versions of this Task that identify key
        state transitions or updates that are likely to be relevant to a user looking
        at the current version of the task.
            :param restriction: If the Task.focus is a request resource and the task is seeking fulfillment
        (i.e. is asking for the request to be actioned), this element identifies any
        limitations on what parts of the referenced request should be actioned.
            :param input: Additional information that may be needed in the execution of the task.
            :param output: Outputs produced by the Task.
