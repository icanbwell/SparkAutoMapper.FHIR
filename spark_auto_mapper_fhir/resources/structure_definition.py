            :param meta: Meta
            :param extension: extensions
            :param url: An absolute URI that is used to identify this structure definition when it is
        referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance; also called its
        canonical identifier. This SHOULD be globally unique and SHOULD be a literal
        address at which at which an authoritative instance of this structure
        definition is (or will be) published. This URL can be the target of a
        canonical reference. It SHALL remain the same when the structure definition is
        stored on different servers.
            :param identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this structure definition when it
        is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
        design or an instance.
            :param version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the structure
        definition when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or
        instance. This is an arbitrary value managed by the structure definition
        author and is not expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a
        timestamp (e.g. yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also
        no expectation that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
            :param name: A natural language name identifying the structure definition. This name should
        be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications
        such as code generation.
            :param title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the structure definition.
            :param status: The status of this structure definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of
        the content.
            :param experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this structure definition is authored for
        testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be
        used for genuine usage.
            :param date: The date  (and optionally time) when the structure definition was published.
        The date must change when the business version changes and it must change if
        the status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
        content of the structure definition changes.
            :param publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the structure
        definition.
            :param contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
        publisher.
            :param description: A free text natural language description of the structure definition from a
        consumer's perspective.
            :param useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
        that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
        or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
        may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate structure
        definition instances.
            :param jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the structure definition is intended to
        be used.
            :param purpose: Explanation of why this structure definition is needed and why it has been
        designed as it has.
            :param copyright: A copyright statement relating to the structure definition and/or its
        contents. Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
        publishing of the structure definition.
            :param keyword: A set of key words or terms from external terminologies that may be used to
        assist with indexing and searching of templates nby describing the use of this
        structure definition, or the content it describes.
            :param fhirVersion: The version of the FHIR specification on which this StructureDefinition is
        based - this is the formal version of the specification, without the revision
        number, e.g. [publication].[major].[minor], which is 4.0.1. for this version.
            :param mapping: An external specification that the content is mapped to.
            :param kind: Defines the kind of structure that this definition is describing.
            :param abstract: Whether structure this definition describes is abstract or not  - that is,
        whether the structure is not intended to be instantiated. For Resources and
        Data types, abstract types will never be exchanged  between systems.
            :param context: Identifies the types of resource or data type elements to which the extension
        can be applied.
            :param contextInvariant: A set of rules as FHIRPath Invariants about when the extension can be used
        (e.g. co-occurrence variants for the extension). All the rules must be true.
            :param type: The type this structure describes. If the derivation kind is 'specialization'
        then this is the master definition for a type, and there is always one of
        these (a data type, an extension, a resource, including abstract ones).
        Otherwise the structure definition is a constraint on the stated type (and in
        this case, the type cannot be an abstract type).  References are URLs that are
        relative to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition e.g. "string" is a
        reference to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/string. Absolute URLs are
        only allowed in logical models.
            :param baseDefinition: An absolute URI that is the base structure from which this type is derived,
        either by specialization or constraint.
            :param derivation: How the type relates to the baseDefinition.
            :param snapshot: A snapshot view is expressed in a standalone form that can be used and
        interpreted without considering the base StructureDefinition.
            :param differential: A differential view is expressed relative to the base StructureDefinition - a
        statement of differences that it applies.
