            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Business identifiers assigned to this goal by the performer or other systems
        which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to
        server.
            :param lifecycleStatus: The state of the goal throughout its lifecycle.
            :param achievementStatus: Describes the progression, or lack thereof, towards the goal against the
        target.
            :param category: Indicates a category the goal falls within.
            :param priority: Identifies the mutually agreed level of importance associated with
        reaching/sustaining the goal.
            :param description: Human-readable and/or coded description of a specific desired objective of
        care, such as "control blood pressure" or "negotiate an obstacle course" or
        "dance with child at wedding".
            :param subject: Identifies the patient, group or organization for whom the goal is being
        established.
            :param startDate: None
            :param startCodeableConcept: None
            :param target: Indicates what should be done by when.
            :param statusDate: Identifies when the current status.  I.e. When initially created, when
        achieved, when cancelled, etc.
            :param statusReason: Captures the reason for the current status.
            :param expressedBy: Indicates whose goal this is - patient goal, practitioner goal, etc.
            :param addresses: The identified conditions and other health record elements that are intended
        to be addressed by the goal.
            :param note: Any comments related to the goal.
            :param outcomeCode: Identifies the change (or lack of change) at the point when the status of the
        goal is assessed.
            :param outcomeReference: Details of what's changed (or not changed).
