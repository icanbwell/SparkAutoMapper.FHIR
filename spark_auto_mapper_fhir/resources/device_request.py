            Represents a request for a patient to employ a medical device. The device may
        be an implantable device, or an external assistive device, such as a walker.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Identifiers assigned to this order by the orderer or by the receiver.
            :param instantiatesCanonical: The URL pointing to a FHIR-defined protocol, guideline, orderset or other
        definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this DeviceRequest.
            :param instantiatesUri: The URL pointing to an externally maintained protocol, guideline, orderset or
        other definition that is adhered to in whole or in part by this DeviceRequest.
            :param basedOn: Plan/proposal/order fulfilled by this request.
            :param priorRequest: The request takes the place of the referenced completed or terminated
        request(s).
            :param groupIdentifier: Composite request this is part of.
            :param status: The status of the request.
            :param intent: Whether the request is a proposal, plan, an original order or a reflex order.
            :param priority: Indicates how quickly the {{title}} should be addressed with respect to other
        requests.
            :param codeReference: None
            :param codeCodeableConcept: None
            :param parameter: Specific parameters for the ordered item.  For example, the prism value for
        lenses.
            :param subject: The patient who will use the device.
            :param encounter: An encounter that provides additional context in which this request is made.
            :param occurrenceDateTime: None
            :param occurrencePeriod: None
            :param occurrenceTiming: None
            :param authoredOn: When the request transitioned to being actionable.
            :param requester: The individual who initiated the request and has responsibility for its
        activation.
            :param performerType: Desired type of performer for doing the diagnostic testing.
            :param performer: The desired performer for doing the diagnostic testing.
            :param reasonCode: Reason or justification for the use of this device.
            :param reasonReference: Reason or justification for the use of this device.
            :param insurance: Insurance plans, coverage extensions, pre-authorizations and/or pre-
        determinations that may be required for delivering the requested service.
            :param supportingInfo: Additional clinical information about the patient that may influence the
        request fulfilment.  For example, this may include where on the subject's body
        the device will be used (i.e. the target site).
            :param note: Details about this request that were not represented at all or sufficiently in
        one of the attributes provided in a class. These may include for example a
        comment, an instruction, or a note associated with the statement.
            :param relevantHistory: Key events in the history of the request.
