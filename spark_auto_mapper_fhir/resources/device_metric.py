        :param id_: id of resource

        :param extension: extensions
        :param identifier: Unique instance identifiers assigned to a device by the device or gateway
    software, manufacturers, other organizations or owners. For example: handle
    ID.
        :param type: Describes the type of the metric. For example: Heart Rate, PEEP Setting, etc.
        :param unit: Describes the unit that an observed value determined for this metric will
    have. For example: Percent, Seconds, etc.
        :param source: Describes the link to the  Device that this DeviceMetric belongs to and that
    contains administrative device information such as manufacturer, serial
    number, etc.
        :param parent: Describes the link to the  Device that this DeviceMetric belongs to and that
    provide information about the location of this DeviceMetric in the containment
    structure of the parent Device. An example would be a Device that represents a
    Channel. This reference can be used by a client application to distinguish
    DeviceMetrics that have the same type, but should be interpreted based on
    their containment location.
        :param operationalStatus: Indicates current operational state of the device. For example: On, Off,
    Standby, etc.
        :param color: Describes the color representation for the metric. This is often used to aid
    clinicians to track and identify parameter types by color. In practice,
    consider a Patient Monitor that has ECG/HR and Pleth for example; the
    parameters are displayed in different characteristic colors, such as HR-blue,
    BP-green, and PR and SpO2- magenta.
        :param category: Indicates the category of the observation generation process. A DeviceMetric
    can be for example a setting, measurement, or calculation.
        :param measurementPeriod: Describes the measurement repetition time. This is not necessarily the same as
    the update period. The measurement repetition time can range from milliseconds
    up to hours. An example for a measurement repetition time in the range of
    milliseconds is the sampling rate of an ECG. An example for a measurement
    repetition time in the range of hours is a NIBP that is triggered
    automatically every hour. The update period may be different than the
    measurement repetition time, if the device does not update the published
    observed value with the same frequency as it was measured.
        :param calibration: Describes the calibrations that have been performed or that are required to be
    performed.
