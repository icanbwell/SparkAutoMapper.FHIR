        including the type of event that initiates the message, the content to be
        transmitted and what response(s), if any, are permitted.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param url: The business identifier that is used to reference the MessageDefinition and
        *is* expected to be consistent from server to server.
            :param identifier: A formal identifier that is used to identify this message definition when it
        is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model,
        design or an instance.
            :param version: The identifier that is used to identify this version of the message definition
        when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or instance. This is
        an arbitrary value managed by the message definition author and is not
        expected to be globally unique. For example, it might be a timestamp (e.g.
        yyyymmdd) if a managed version is not available. There is also no expectation
        that versions can be placed in a lexicographical sequence.
            :param name: A natural language name identifying the message definition. This name should
        be usable as an identifier for the module by machine processing applications
        such as code generation.
            :param title: A short, descriptive, user-friendly title for the message definition.
            :param replaces: A MessageDefinition that is superseded by this definition.
            :param status: The status of this message definition. Enables tracking the life-cycle of the
        content.
            :param experimental: A Boolean value to indicate that this message definition is authored for
        testing purposes (or education/evaluation/marketing) and is not intended to be
        used for genuine usage.
            :param date: The date  (and optionally time) when the message definition was published. The
        date must change when the business version changes and it must change if the
        status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive
        content of the message definition changes.
            :param publisher: The name of the organization or individual that published the message
        definition.
            :param contact: Contact details to assist a user in finding and communicating with the
        publisher.
            :param description: A free text natural language description of the message definition from a
        consumer's perspective.
            :param useContext: The content was developed with a focus and intent of supporting the contexts
        that are listed. These contexts may be general categories (gender, age, ...)
        or may be references to specific programs (insurance plans, studies, ...) and
        may be used to assist with indexing and searching for appropriate message
        definition instances.
            :param jurisdiction: A legal or geographic region in which the message definition is intended to be
        used.
            :param purpose: Explanation of why this message definition is needed and why it has been
        designed as it has.
            :param copyright: A copyright statement relating to the message definition and/or its contents.
        Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and
        publishing of the message definition.
            :param base: The MessageDefinition that is the basis for the contents of this resource.
            :param parent: Identifies a protocol or workflow that this MessageDefinition represents a
        step in.
            :param eventCoding: None
            :param eventUri: None
            :param category: The impact of the content of the message.
            :param focus: Identifies the resource (or resources) that are being addressed by the event.
        For example, the Encounter for an admit message or two Account records for a
        merge.
            :param responseRequired: Declare at a message definition level whether a response is required or only
        upon error or success, or never.
            :param allowedResponse: Indicates what types of messages may be sent as an application-level response
        to this message.
            :param graph: Canonical reference to a GraphDefinition. If a URL is provided, it is the
        canonical reference to a [[[GraphDefinition]]] that it controls what resources
        are to be added to the bundle when building the document. The GraphDefinition
        can also specify profiles that apply to the various resources.
