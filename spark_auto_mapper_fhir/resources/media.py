        content may be inline or provided by direct reference.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Identifiers associated with the image - these may include identifiers for the
        image itself, identifiers for the context of its collection (e.g. series ids)
        and context ids such as accession numbers or other workflow identifiers.
            :param basedOn: A procedure that is fulfilled in whole or in part by the creation of this
        media.
            :param partOf: A larger event of which this particular event is a component or step.
            :param status: The current state of the {{title}}.
            :param type_: A code that classifies whether the media is an image, video or audio recording
        or some other media category.
            :param modality: Details of the type of the media - usually, how it was acquired (what type of
        device). If images sourced from a DICOM system, are wrapped in a Media
        resource, then this is the modality.
            :param view: The name of the imaging view e.g. Lateral or Antero-posterior (AP).
            :param subject: Who/What this Media is a record of.
            :param encounter: The encounter that establishes the context for this media.
            :param createdDateTime: None
            :param createdPeriod: None
            :param issued: The date and time this version of the media was made available to providers,
        typically after having been reviewed.
            :param operator: The person who administered the collection of the image.
            :param reasonCode: Describes why the event occurred in coded or textual form.
            :param bodySite: Indicates the site on the subject's body where the observation was made (i.e.
        the target site).
            :param deviceName: The name of the device / manufacturer of the device  that was used to make the
        recording.
            :param device: The device used to collect the media.
            :param height: Height of the image in pixels (photo/video).
            :param width: Width of the image in pixels (photo/video).
            :param frames: The number of frames in a photo. This is used with a multi-page fax, or an
        imaging acquisition context that takes multiple slices in a single image, or
        an animated gif. If there is more than one frame, this SHALL have a value in
        order to alert interface software that a multi-frame capable rendering widget
        is required.
            :param duration: The duration of the recording in seconds - for audio and video.
            :param content: The actual content of the media - inline or by direct reference to the media
        source file.
            :param note: Comments made about the media by the performer, subject or other participants.
