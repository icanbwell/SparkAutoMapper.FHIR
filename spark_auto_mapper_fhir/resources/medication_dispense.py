        medication order.
            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: Identifiers associated with this Medication Dispense that are defined by
        business processes and/or used to refer to it when a direct URL reference to
        the resource itself is not appropriate. They are business identifiers assigned
        to this resource by the performer or other systems and remain constant as the
        resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
            :param partOf: The procedure that trigger the dispense.
            :param status: A code specifying the state of the set of dispense events.
            :param statusReasonCodeableConcept: None
            :param statusReasonReference: None
            :param category: Indicates the type of medication dispense (for example, where the medication
        is expected to be consumed or administered (i.e. inpatient or outpatient)).
            :param medicationCodeableConcept: None
            :param medicationReference: None
            :param subject: A link to a resource representing the person or the group to whom the
        medication will be given.
            :param context: The encounter or episode of care that establishes the context for this event.
            :param supportingInformation: Additional information that supports the medication being dispensed.
            :param performer: Indicates who or what performed the event.
            :param location: The principal physical location where the dispense was performed.
            :param authorizingPrescription: Indicates the medication order that is being dispensed against.
            :param type_: Indicates the type of dispensing event that is performed. For example, Trial
        Fill, Completion of Trial, Partial Fill, Emergency Fill, Samples, etc.
            :param quantity: The amount of medication that has been dispensed. Includes unit of measure.
            :param daysSupply: The amount of medication expressed as a timing amount.
            :param whenPrepared: The time when the dispensed product was packaged and reviewed.
            :param whenHandedOver: The time the dispensed product was provided to the patient or their
        representative.
            :param destination: Identification of the facility/location where the medication was shipped to,
        as part of the dispense event.
            :param receiver: Identifies the person who picked up the medication.  This will usually be a
        patient or their caregiver, but some cases exist where it can be a healthcare
        professional.
            :param note: Extra information about the dispense that could not be conveyed in the other
        attributes.
            :param dosageInstruction: Indicates how the medication is to be used by the patient.
            :param substitution: Indicates whether or not substitution was made as part of the dispense.  In
        some cases, substitution will be expected but does not happen, in other cases
        substitution is not expected but does happen.  This block explains what
        substitution did or did not happen and why.  If nothing is specified,
        substitution was not done.
            :param detectedIssue: Indicates an actual or potential clinical issue with or between one or more
        active or proposed clinical actions for a patient; e.g. drug-drug interaction,
        duplicate therapy, dosage alert etc.
            :param eventHistory: A summary of the events of interest that have occurred, such as when the
        dispense was verified.
