            If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions

            :param id_: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
        assigned, this value never changes.
            :param meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
        infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with
        version changes to the resource.
            :param implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
        constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often,
        this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules
        along with other profiles etc.
            :param language: The base language in which the resource is written.
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
        Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
        narrative to ensure clinical safety.
            :param contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
        that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
        have their own independent transaction scope.
            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element
        that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements
        that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications
        processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param identifier: This records identifiers associated with this appointment response concern
        that are defined by business processes and/ or used to refer to it when a
        direct URL reference to the resource itself is not appropriate.
            :param appointment: Appointment that this response is replying to.
            :param start: Date/Time that the appointment is to take place, or requested new start time.
            :param end: This may be either the same as the appointment request to confirm the details
        of the appointment, or alternately a new time to request a re-negotiation of
        the end time.
            :param participantType: Role of participant in the appointment.
            :param actor: A Person, Location, HealthcareService, or Device that is participating in the
        appointment.
            :param participantStatus: Participation status of the participant. When the status is declined or
        tentative if the start/end times are different to the appointment, then these
        times should be interpreted as a requested time change. When the status is
        accepted, the times can either be the time of the appointment (as a
        confirmation of the time) or can be empty.
            :param comment: Additional comments about the appointment.
