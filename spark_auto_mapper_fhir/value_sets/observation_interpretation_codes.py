    ObservationInterpretationCodes
    From: http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-interpretation in valuesets.xml
        A categorical assessment, providing a rough qualitative interpretation of the
    observation value,    such as “normal”/ “abnormal”,”low” / “high”, “better” /
    “worse”, “susceptible” / “resistant”, “expected”/ “not expected”.    The value
    set is intended to be for ANY use where coded representation of an
    interpretation is needed.

       Notes:

       This is being communicated in v2.x in OBX-8 (Observation Interpretation),
    in v3 in ObservationInterpretation (CWE) in R1 (Representative Realm) and in
    FHIR in    Observation.interpretation. Historically these values come from the
    laboratory domain, and these codes are extensively    used. The value set
    binding is extensible, so codes outside the value set that are needed for
    interpretation concepts    (i.e. particular meanings) that are not included in
    the value set can be used, and these new codes may also be added to    the
    value set and published in a future version.

                               Open Issue: EX, HX, LX: These three concepts do not
    seem to meet a clear need in the vocabulary, and their use in observation
    interpretation appears likely to be covered by other existing concepts (e.g.,
    A, H, L).  The only apparent significant difference is their reference to use
    in protocols for exclusion of study subjects.
    These concepts/codes were proposed by RCRIM for use in the CTLaboratory
    message.  They were submitted and approved in the November 2005 Harmonization
    cycle in proposal "030103C_VOCAB_RCRIM_l_quade_RCRIM Obs
    Interp_20051028154455".  However, this proposal was not fully implemented in
    the vocabulary.  The proposal recommended creation of the
    x_ClinicalResearchExclusion domain in ObservationInterpretation with a value
    set including those three concepts/codes, but there is no subdomain of that
    name or equivalent with a binding to either of the value sets that contain
    these concepts/codes.
    Members of the OO WG have recently attempted to contact members of RCRIM
    regarding these concepts, both by email and at the recent WGM in Atlanta,
    without response.  It is felt by OO that the best course of action to take at
    this time is to add this comprehensive Open Issue rather than deprecate these
    three concepts at this time, until further discussion is held.
