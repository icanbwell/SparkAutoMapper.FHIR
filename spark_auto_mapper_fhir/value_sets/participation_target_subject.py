         The principle target that the service acts on.  E.g. the patient in physical
    examination, a specimen in a lab observation. May also be a patient's family
    member (teaching) or a device or room (cleaning, disinfecting, housekeeping).
    Note: not all direct targets are subjects, consumables, and devices used as
    tools for a service are not subjects.  However, a device may be a subject of a
    maintenance service.
