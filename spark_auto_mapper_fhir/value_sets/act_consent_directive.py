                               The security policy identifiers shall be identical
                               The classification level of the initiator shall be
    greater than or equal to that of the target (that is, there shall be at least
    one value in the classification list of the clearance greater than or equal to
    the classification of the target), and
                               For each security category in the target label,
    there shall be a security category of the same type in the initiator's
    clearance and the initiator's classification level shall dominate that of the
    target.
    
    
                               Examples: SecurityObservationType  security label
    fields include:
    
    
                               Confidentiality classification
                               Compartment category
