    From: http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-hl7Realm in v3-codesystems.xml
          Description:
    Coded concepts representing Binding Realms (used for Context Binding of
    terminology in HL7 models)  and/or Namespace Realms (used to help ensure
    unique identification of HL7 artifacts). This code system is partitioned into
    three sections: Affiliate realms, Binding realms and Namespace realms.  All
    affiliate realm codes may automatically be used as both binding realms and
    namespace realms.  Furthermore, affiliate realms are the only realms that have
    authority over the creation of binding realms.  (Note that 'affiliate'
    includes the idea of both international affiliates and the HL7 International
    organization.)  All other codes must be associated with an owning affiliate
    realm and must appear as a specialization of _BindingRealm or _NamespaceRealm.
    For affiliates whose concepts align with nations, the country codes from ISO
    3166-1 2-character alpha are used for the code when possible so these codes
    should not be used for other realm types.  It is recommended that binding
    realm and namespace codes submitted by affiliates use the realm code as a
    prefix to avoid possible collisions with ISO codes.  However, tooling does not
    currently support namepace realm codes greater than 2 characters.  Open Issue:
    The name of the concept property "owningAffiliate" should be changed to better
    reflect that the property value is the human readable name of the
    organizational entity that manages the Realm identified by the Realm Code.
    Open Issue:
    In spite of the inability of tooling to process codes longer than 2
    characters, there is at least one realm codes ('SOA') that was added that is 3
    characters in length.
