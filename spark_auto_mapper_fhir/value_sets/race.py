         In the United States, federal standards for classifying data on race
    determine the categories used by federal agencies and exert a strong influence
    on categorization by state and local agencies and private sector
    organizations.  The federal standards do not conceptually define race, and
    they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for
    racial classification.  Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race
    is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification
    with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification. The
    standards use a variety of features to define five minimum race categories.
    Among these features are descent from "the original peoples" of a specified
    region or nation.  The minimum race categories are American Indian or Alaska
    Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
    Islander, and White.  The federal standards stipulate that race data need not
    be limited to the five minimum categories, but any expansion must be
    collapsible to those categories.
