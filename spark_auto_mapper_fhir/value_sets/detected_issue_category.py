                           The security policy identifiers shall be identical
                           The classification level of the initiator shall be greater than or equal to that of the target (that is, there shall be at least one value in the classification list of the clearance greater than or equal to the classification of the target), and 
                           For each security category in the target label, there shall be a security category of the same type in the initiator's clearance and the initiator's classification level shall dominate that of the target.
                        
                        
                           Examples: SecurityObservationType  security label fields include:
