    greater than or equal to that of the target (that is, there shall be at least
    one value in the classification list of the clearance greater than or equal to
    the classification of the target), and
                               For each security category in the target label,
    there shall be a security category of the same type in the initiator's

    the classification of the target), and
                               For each security category in the target label,

                               The classification level of the initiator shall be
    greater than or equal to that of the target (that is, there shall be at least
    one value in the classification list of the clearance greater than or equal to
    the classification of the target), and
                               For each security category in the target label,
