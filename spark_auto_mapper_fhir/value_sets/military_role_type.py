    Description: A role recognized through the eligibility of an identified party
    for benefits covered under an insurance policy or a program based on meeting
    eligibility criteria.
    
                            Eligibility as a covered party may be conditioned on
    the party meeting criteria to qualify for coverage under a policy or program,
    which may be mandated by law.  These criteria may be:
    
    
    
                                  The sole basis for coverage, e.g., being
    differently abled may qualify a person for disability coverage
    
    
    
                                  May more fully qualify a covered party role e.g,
    being differently abled may qualify an adult child as a dependent
    
    
    
                                  May impact the level of coverage for a covered
    party under a policy or program, e.g., being differently abled may qualify a
    program eligible for additional benefits.
    
    
    
    
                               Discussion:  The Abstract Value Set
    "CoverageRoleType", which was developed for use in the Canadian realm "pre-
    coordinate" coverage roles with other roles that a covered party must play in
    order to be eligible for coverage, e.g., "handicapped dependent".   These
    role.codes may only be used with COVPTY to avoid overlapping concepts that
    would result from using them to specify the specializations of COVPTY, e.g.,
    the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code family dependent
    because that relationship has overlapping concepts due to the role.code
    precoodination and is conveyed in FICO with the personal relationship role
    that has a PART role link to the covered party role.  For the same reasons,
    the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code HANDIC (handicapped
    dependent); the role.code DIFFABLE (differently abled) should be used instead.
    
                            In summary, the coded concepts in the Abstract Value
    Set "CoveredPartyRoleType" can be "post-coordinated" with the
    "RoleClassCoveredParty" Abstract Value Set.  Decoupling these concepts is
    intended to support an expansive range of covered party concepts and their
    semantic comparability.
