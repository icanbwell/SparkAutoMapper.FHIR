        - to a contained StructureDefinition, or a reference to another
        StructureDefinition or Implementation Guide by a canonical URL. When an
        implementation guide is specified, the type SHALL conform to at least one

        structure or implementation Guide that applies to the target of the reference
        this element refers to. If any profiles are specified, then the content must
        conform to at least one of them. The URL can be a local reference - to a
        contained StructureDefinition, or a reference to another StructureDefinition

        a bundle, is it included in the bundle.

        whether either can be used.
