        the lower bound of the allowed range of count values.
            :param countMax: If present, indicates that the count is a range - so to perform the action
        between [count] and [countMax] times.

        this element indicates the lower bound of the allowed range of the duration.

        between [duration] and [durationMax] time length.
            :param durationUnit: The units of time for the duration, in UCUM units.

        frequencyMax is present, this element indicates the lower bound of the allowed
        range of the frequency.
            :param frequencyMax: If present, indicates that the frequency is a range - so to repeat between
        [frequency] and [frequencyMax] times within the period or period range.
            :param period: Indicates the duration of time over which repetitions are to occur; e.g. to
        express "3 times per day", 3 would be the frequency and "1 day" would be the
        period. If periodMax is present, this element indicates the lower bound of the
        allowed range of the period length.
            :param periodMax: If present, indicates that the period is a range from [period] to [periodMax],
        allowing expressing concepts such as "do this once every 3-5 days.

            :param when: An approximate time period during the day, potentially linked to an event of
        daily living that indicates when the action should occur.
            :param offset: The number of minutes from the event. If the event code does not indicate
        whether the minutes is before or after the event, then the offset is assumed
        to be after the event.
