            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
        in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
        be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
        resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource
        or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension
        itself).
            :param title: The label for this particular section.  This will be part of the rendered
        content for the document, and is often used to build a table of contents.
            :param code: A code identifying the kind of content contained within the section. This must
        be consistent with the section title.
            :param author: Identifies who is responsible for the information in this section, not
        necessarily who typed it in.
            :param focus: The actual focus of the section when it is not the subject of the composition,
        but instead represents something or someone associated with the subject such
        as (for a patient subject) a spouse, parent, fetus, or donor. If not focus is
        specified, the focus is assumed to be focus of the parent section, or, for a
        section in the Composition itself, the subject of the composition. Sections
        with a focus SHALL only include resources where the logical subject (patient,
        subject, focus, etc.) matches the section focus, or the resources have no
        logical subject (few resources).
            :param text: A human-readable narrative that contains the attested content of the section,
        used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
        not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
        detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            :param mode: How the entry list was prepared - whether it is a working list that is
        suitable for being maintained on an ongoing basis, or if it represents a
        snapshot of a list of items from another source, or whether it is a prepared
        list where items may be marked as added, modified or deleted.
            :param orderedBy: Specifies the order applied to the items in the section entries.
            :param entry: A reference to the actual resource from which the narrative in the section is
        derived.
            :param emptyReason: If the section is empty, why the list is empty. An empty section typically has
        some text explaining the empty reason.
            :param section: A nested sub-section within this section.
