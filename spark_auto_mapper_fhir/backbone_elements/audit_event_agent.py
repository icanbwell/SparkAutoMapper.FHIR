        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
        in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
        be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
        resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        event.
            :param role: The security role that the user was acting under, that come from local codes
        defined by the access control security system (e.g. RBAC, ABAC) used in the
        local context.
            :param who: Reference to who this agent is that was involved in the event.
            :param altId: Alternative agent Identifier. For a human, this should be a user identifier
        text string from authentication system. This identifier would be one known to
        a common authentication system (e.g. single sign-on), if available.
            :param name: Human-meaningful name for the agent.
            :param requestor: Indicator that the user is or is not the requestor, or initiator, for the
        event being audited.
            :param location: Where the event occurred.
            :param policy: The policy or plan that authorized the activity being recorded. Typically, a
        single activity may have multiple applicable policies, such as patient
        consent, guarantor funding, etc. The policy would also indicate the security
        token used.
            :param media: Type of media involved. Used when the event is about exporting/importing onto
        media.
            :param network: Logical network location for application activity, if the activity has a
        network location.
            :param purposeOfUse: The reason (purpose of use), specific to this agent, that was used during the
