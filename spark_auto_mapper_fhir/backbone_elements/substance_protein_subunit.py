        definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
        in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

        have sequential subscripts.

        SubstanceProteins will always be described using the translated sequence; for
        synthetic peptide containing amino acids that are not represented with a
