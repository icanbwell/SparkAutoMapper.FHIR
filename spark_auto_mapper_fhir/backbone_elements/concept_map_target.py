        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
        in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

        implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
        be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
        resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        editing the concept map.
            :param equivalence: The equivalence between the source and target concepts (counting for the
        dependencies and products). The equivalence is read from target to source
        (e.g. the target is 'wider' than the source).

        not represented in  the structured data.
            :param dependsOn: A set of additional dependencies for this mapping to hold. This mapping is
        only applicable if the specified element can be resolved, and it has the
        specified value.
            :param product: A set of additional outcomes from this mapping to other elements. To properly
        execute this mapping, the specified element must be mapped to some data
        element or source that is in context. The mapping may still be useful without
        a place for the additional data elements, but the equivalence cannot be relied
        on.
