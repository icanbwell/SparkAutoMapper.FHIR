        definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
        in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To
        make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of
        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL

        from a terminology, allowing supplemental data to be correlated across
        measures.
            :param usage: An indicator of the intended usage for the supplemental data element.
        Supplemental data indicates the data is additional information requested to
        augment the measure information. Risk adjustment factor indicates the data is
        additional information used to calculate risk adjustment factors when applying
        a risk model to the measure calculation.

        expression defined within a referenced library, but it may also be a path to a
        specific data element. The criteria defines the data to be returned for this
        element.
