        definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
        in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

        implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL

        dispense. This means that if an order indicates dispense 30 tablets plus "3
        repeats", then the order can be dispensed a total of 4 times and the patient
        can receive a total of 120 tablets.  A prescriber may explicitly say that zero
