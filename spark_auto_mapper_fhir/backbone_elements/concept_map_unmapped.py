        definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param modifierExtension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element
        in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's
        descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To

        governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any
        implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL
        be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a
        resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

        the target system designated for the group. One of 3 actions are possible: use
        the unmapped code (this is useful when doing a mapping between versions, and
        only a few codes have changed), use a fixed code (a default code), or
        alternatively, a reference to a different concept map can be provided (by
        canonical URL).
            :param code: The fixed code to use when the mode = 'fixed'  - all unmapped codes are mapped
        to a single fixed code.
            :param display: The display for the code. The display is only provided to help editors when
        editing the concept map.
            :param url: The canonical reference to an additional ConceptMap resource instance to use
        for mapping if this ConceptMap resource contains no matching mapping for the
        source concept.
