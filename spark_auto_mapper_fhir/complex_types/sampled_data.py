        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.

        one, then the dimensions will be interlaced - all the sample points for a
        point in time will be recorded at once.
            :param data: A series of data points which are decimal values separated by a single space
        (character u20). The special values "E" (error), "L" (below detection limit)
        and "U" (above detection limit) can also be used in place of a decimal value.
