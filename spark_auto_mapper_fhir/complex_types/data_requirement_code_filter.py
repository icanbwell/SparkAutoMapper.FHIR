            :param extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
        definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param path: The code-valued attribute of the filter. The specified path SHALL be a
        FHIRPath resolveable on the specified type of the DataRequirement, and SHALL
        consist only of identifiers, constant indexers, and .resolve(). The path is
        allowed to contain qualifiers (.) to traverse sub-elements, as well as
        indexers ([x]) to traverse multiple-cardinality sub-elements (see the [Simple
        FHIRPath Profile](fhirpath.html#simple) for full details). Note that the index
        must be an integer constant. The path must resolve to an element of type code,
        Coding, or CodeableConcept.
            :param searchParam: A token parameter that refers to a search parameter defined on the specified
        type of the DataRequirement, and which searches on elements of type code,
        Coding, or CodeableConcept.
            :param valueSet: The valueset for the code filter. The valueSet and code elements are additive.
        If valueSet is specified, the filter will return only those data items for
        which the value of the code-valued element specified in the path is a member
        of the specified valueset.
            :param code: The codes for the code filter. If values are given, the filter will return
        only those data items for which the code-valued attribute specified by the
        path has a value that is one of the specified codes. If codes are specified in
        addition to a value set, the filter returns items matching a code in the value
        set or one of the specified codes.
