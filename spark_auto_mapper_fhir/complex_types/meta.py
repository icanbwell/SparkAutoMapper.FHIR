        definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
        there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
        extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
        requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
            :param versionId: The version specific identifier, as it appears in the version portion of the
        URL. This value changes when the resource is created, updated, or deleted.
            :param lastUpdated: When the resource last changed - e.g. when the version changed.
            :param source: A uri that identifies the source system of the resource. This provides a
        minimal amount of [[[Provenance]]] information that can be used to track or
        differentiate the source of information in the resource. The source may
        identify another FHIR server, document, message, database, etc.
            :param profile: A list of profiles (references to [[[StructureDefinition]]] resources) that
        this resource claims to conform to. The URL is a reference to
        [[[StructureDefinition.url]]].
            :param security: Security labels applied to this resource. These tags connect specific
        resources to the overall security policy and infrastructure.
            :param tag: Tags applied to this resource. Tags are intended to be used to identify and
        relate resources to process and workflow, and applications are not required to
        consider the tags when interpreting the meaning of a resource.
