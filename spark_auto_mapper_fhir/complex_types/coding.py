        that a well-maintained code system does not need the version reported, because
        the meaning of codes is consistent across versions. However this cannot
        consistently be assured, and when the meaning is not guaranteed to be
        consistent, the version SHOULD be exchanged.

        or an expression in a syntax defined by the coding system (e.g. post-

        of the system.
